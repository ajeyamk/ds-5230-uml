6,_69.subject,"Liane,   As we discussed yesterday, I am concerned there has been an attempt to  manipulate the  El Paso San Juan monthly index. A single buyer entered the  marketplace on both September 26 and 27 and paid above market prices  ($4.70-$4.80) for San Juan gas with the intent to distort the index. At the  time of these trades, offers for physical gas at significantly (10 to 15  cents) lower prices were bypassed in order to establish higher trades to  report into the index calculation. Additionally, these trades are out of  line with the associated financial swaps for San Juan. We have compiled a list of financial and physical trades executed from  September 25 to September 27. These are the complete list of trades from  Enron Online (EOL), Enron's direct phone conversations, and three brokerage  firms (Amerex, APB, and Prebon). Please see the attached spreadsheet for a  trade by trade list and a summary. We have also included a summary of gas  daily prices to illustrate the value of San Juan based on several spread  relationships. The two key points from this data are as follows:   1. The high physical prices on the 26th & 27th (4.75,4,80) are much greater  than the high financial trades (4.6375,4.665) on those days. 2. The spread relationship between San Juan and other points (Socal &  Northwest)  is  consistent between the end of September and         October gas daily. It doesn't make sense to have monthly indeces that  are dramatically different. I understand you review the trades submitted for outliers. Hopefully, the  trades submitted will reveal counterparty names and you will be able to  determine that there was only one buyer in the 4.70's and these trades are  outliers. I wanted to give you some additional points of reference to aid in  establishing a reasonable index. It is Enron's belief that the trades at  $4.70 and higher  were above market trades that should be excluded from the  calculation of index. It is our desire to have reliable and accurate indeces against which to  conduct our physical and financial business. Please contact me  anytime I can assist you towards this goal.

8,_377.subject,"I am changing the way the curve is generated starting in Jan 2004 to better  replicate seasonal fundamentals. There are convincing arguments as to why  the summer/winter spreads should tighten over time. However, in the previous  methodology they blew out. For instance summer/winter in Cal 3 was .232  while Cal 10 was .256. I have added a seasonality dampening function that both contracts the  summer/winter spread and applies a premium to the electric load demand months  of July and August over time. The formula for the curve remains the same except for a premium lookup for  the month as well as for the year. These premiums are as follows:  Jan  -.008 Feb -.004 Mar -.001 Apr .002 May .003 Jun .004 Jul .004 Aug .004 Sep .003 Oct .002 Nov -.003 Dec -.006   These premiums start in Jan 2004 On Wednesday Jan 2003 settled 2.959,  the 3/4 spread was marked at .0375, the  4/5 spread was marked at .0475. In the old methodology Jan 2003  = 2.959 Jan 2004  = 2.959 + .0375 = 2.9965 Jan 2005  =          2.9965 + .0475 = 3.044   In the new methodology Jan 2003  = 2.959 Jan 2004  = 2.959 + .0375 - .008 =2.9885 Jan 2005  = 2.9885 + .0475 -.008 = 3.028  The only change in the formula is from: Month x = Month (x- 1 year) + lookup on year on year table to Month x = Month (x- 1 year) + lookup on year on year table + lookup on month  premium table  The seasonality premiums will change over time and I will let you know when I  change them",New curve generation methodology,arnold-j

127,_188.subject,"While recruiting on campus recently I became aware that a decision was made  at the Program level to not interview this fall for 2001 summer interns. In  talking with students and faculty at The University of Texas and University  of Oklahoma, it became clear that there is concern over the feasibility of an  internship with Enron, as other top firms will be recruiting this fall for  summer 2001 interns. I have communicated my concerns to Lexi Elliott and her  manager, Shelley Jones, and was told by both that the decision to delay  interviews for summer interns was made at a Program level based on Enron's  staffing. When I asked about the competitive data available regarding the  practice of other firms on summer intern interviews, I was even more  concerned to discover that neither Lexi nor Shelley had that data. It would  seem critical to know what the competition is doing in terms of summer intern  interview schedules in order to understand the risk that could be created for  Enron by not interviewing this fall for these important feeder positions for  our Analyst and Associates programs. I have had conversations over the last two weeks with Lexi and Shelley, with  no resolution. When they could not provide the competitive data to either  confirm or eliminate my concerns, I volunteered to have James Scribner, a   Senior Director on my team, obtain this market information. Lexi and Shelley  either did not have the time to gather this data, or were not sure how to do  so. They were pleased to have some help in getting our hands on this  critical information. I now have information at hand with regard to firms  that will be recruiting at UT and OU this fall for summer intern positions. And based on this information, I believe that Enron is at risk for not hiring  top students as interns for the summer of 2001 if we do not interview for  these positions this fall. While my research only touches on two of the schools at which Enron recruits,  I want to raise concern over this as a potential problem at many, if not all  campuses that we have targeted for recruiting. As administrators of the  program, you rely on the involvement of senior members of the company to  carry the Enron message to campus. I believe that we also have an obligation  to make this a two-way messaging system. I strongly believe that we must  address this potential risk for Enron extremely quickly, as teams will be on  campuses across the country to conduct interviews in a matter of days. I  suspect that many Enron participants in the recruiting process are unaware of  the Program's decision regarding the timing of interviews for summer  internships. In working with Rick Causey and Mike McConnell, executive  sponsors for UT and OU, respectively, they are as concerned as I about the  decision on interviewing summer interns. I have copied both of them on this  note to the two of you. Please let me know how this can be resolved. With the help of James Scribner  and others, we have already compiled a list of students at UT and OU that  should be targeted for summer internships. I will offer as much of my time  as is feasible to work with staff members of the Program to devise creative  ways to turn this around.",Hiring Practices for Summer Interns,beck-s

170,_376.subject,"Today was the final ENA PRC. Relative ranking results up through the Senior  Director level are final. You and your management team can begin the process  of giving performance reviews to your employees. I spoke with Sheila Walton  today to inquire about an expected time frame for completing and conducting  the employee reviews. She indicated that the target completion date should  be the end of July. Promotions will be effective August 1st. It is Dave Delainey's intent to  announce ENA promotions sometime after he returns from vacation on July 24. This drives the end of July target completion date for reviews. I do not  yet know if Delainey wants all ENA promotions to be announced in a single  memo, or if each group within ENA will prepare such a memo. I will keep you  updated on this as I get direction from him. Please note the following change since our Energy Operations PRC in June. In  order to place focus on the qualitative feedback during this mid-year review  process, we will not share performance clusters with employees when  conducting their reviews. It is very important for all of us to be  consistent in this process, so please communicate this to all in your groups  who will be giving performance reviews. It is important to note, however,  that the content of an employee's review should be consistent with our view  of that employee's relative ranking. In other words, an employee in the  Satisfactory category should not be given a review that simply states that  the employee is doing a great job. Clearly, a large number of employees  performed at a higher level than those employees in the Satisfactory  category, so the feedback to that employee should include some specific areas  of improvement needed in order for the employee to make a stronger impact in  the organization, help you achieve the groups goals, etc. Also please note the following:   Performance reviews for anyone in the Satisfactory, Needs Improvement or  Issues categories must be reviewed by HR prior to these reviews being given  to the employees. This will ensure that our feedback is commensurate with  the relative performance of that employee. (This has been the stated process  for the bottom two categories, and we are adding Satisfactory to this process  as well.) Please remember to include a more experienced member of your management team,  yourself, or an HR professional in reviews being conducted by inexperienced  members of your management team, or those management team members where you  have a concern over their ability or willingness to deliver candid and  perhaps tough performance feedback. I believe that we have spent some time  in identifying these situations. I ask your help to ensure that we follow  through on this commitment.

I don't know your agenda for the meeting, so  it may or may not be appropriate to discuss all of these items tomorrow. Background:  As a long-time supporter of the analyst program, I became  concerned over the last several months as frustration emerged from other  supporters of the program. Many of those expressing frustration are heavily  involved in the recruiting process. It is their commitment to both  recruiting and providing analyst rotations that has been key in attracting  talented candidates to what has been the Merchant Services Analyst Program. I initiated a meeting, announced at Rick Causey's staff meeting, that would  bring us together so that we could consolidate our concerns and then discuss  them with you in a constructive manner. Our intent is continued support and  improvement of the program. The meeting took place on March 28 and included  the following:   Brenda Herod   ENA - Energy Operations Executive Lead - LSU   Brent Price  ENA - Energy Operations Executive Lead - UT     Jeff Sommers  CALME    Executive Lead - Univsersity of Florida   Ed Coats  Corp. Tax    Core Team Member - UT, A&M, LSU and University of  Florida   Sally Beck  ENA - Energy Operations Executive Lead - UT and OU   Carolyn Barrett  EBS       Howard Selzer  Enron Global E&P    Summary of Concerns and Discussion Points:  One program, or two:  Prior to campus recruiting in the fall 1999, an  announcement  was made that there would be one analyst program. Not much  materialized from that point to clarify what that meant or how that would be  managed. In fact, those of us involved heavily in the recruiting process saw  that the MSAP and the Commercial Anlayst programs were managed separately and  differently in terms of campus recruiting, rotations and orientation. We  feel uninformed and therefore are hampered in discussing the analyst program  on campus. SIngle start date:  The single start date of July 17 for analysts is  impractical and inflexible; a concern from our points of view for an  innovative company. The July start date does not consider December graduates  and is not necessarily practical for undergrads whose graduation dates are in  May. Lack of communication:   We are some of the most involved and committed  senior managers in the MSAP, and yet we have received little information or  communication about the program. We hear rumors of ""tracks"", but no facts  or details. Some of us had heard about the single July start date, and some  had not. Commercial focus too heavy:  Presentation materials, the attitudes of support  staff in the Associates/Analysts Program and interview processes are heavily  focused on commercial needs, without understanding support needs. Lack of input from biggest supporters:  Given the time and effort that many  of us put into the MSAP, we are concerned that we haven't been asked to join  with you in some of your plans for the program. We are concerned that  decisions (example:  the single start date) are being considered in a vacuum  without what could be some valuable input from some of us. MSAP has taken a step backward:  Previously, with a dedicated leadership team  and staff, the MSAP had made great strides in the consistency of our on  campus efforts, the quality of candidates, the acceptance rate of top  candidates and the pride of participants in the program. We feel that the  focus on the MSAP has diminished considerably over the last nine months, and  we are anxious to work with you to renew excitment for the program.

213,_550.subject,"Brent Price and I will be in the London office next week, arriving Monday  morning and returning to Houston on Friday. The purpose of my visit is in  regard to my Global Risk Management Operations role,   I believe that Rick  Causey met with you regarding some operations support that Brent and I will  provide to Fernley during a transition period prior to the arrival and during  the assimilation of Michael Jordan, the JP Morgan staffer that Fernley has  hired. Brent and I will be working with Fernley next week to iron out the  details of our support for Fernley during that transition period. We will  also map out an Enron trading operations introduction  for Michael Jordan,  which may involve a short stint for him in Houston. My goal is to provide a  strong resource to Fernley during this transition period and to work with  Fernley to provide whatever assistance, training, and orientation to Michael  in his role so that his assimilation can be as smooth and effective as  possible. Another purpose for the trip is to spend some time with Fernley and his   business controllers  to get their ideas on specific goals that as a group we  would commit to for 2000. I know that Barry and Richard Sage have many good  ideas on how we can leverage knowledge and best practices across all Enron  locations with trading operations. My earlier trips to London this year were  focused solely on Helsinki, and did not allow time to positively focus on  leveraging worldwide operations experience. I value input from other trading  operations professionals and I look forward to the ideas that can be  generated in working with Barry, Richard and some of their direct reports. I also contacted Tani Nath about my trip to see how I could support her as  she moves into her role in Global Products. I have not heard  from Tani, but  I understand from others that she will be in the Houston office next week. It will be unfortunate to miss her on my trip, but based on my commitments in  Houston and Rick Causey's desire to move forward on providing trading  operations support to Fernley, next week is the best for me to be in London. I did meet with Tani for an hour when she was here week before last and  offered to help her in any way if she made the decision to accept the role  over Global Products. I trust that she will contact me for that support as  needed. I have scheduled a short meeting one on one with you while I am there to  discuss how my global role can provide support and resources for your  business efforts in London. I look forward to meeting with you next week. This trip is not a leg of the worldwide operations/control review that we are  conducting at Joe Sutton's request. By circumstance, as you know, we have  taken a look at Helsinki and subsequently Oslo and Frankfurt. There will be  a similar review of Continental power, UK gas, UK power and global liquids. The review teams are currently focused on operations/controls reviews of  North American locations and some entities in the US in which Enron has a  large ownership position. It is likely that the continuation of this effort  in London will occur in mid April. Copies of the drafts of the findings for Oslo and Frankfurt were provided to  Fernley as soon as the team returned to Houston. We hope to finalise those  drafts this week as we receive comments from Fernley and the business  managers in Oslo and Frankfurt to whom those drafts were provided. Fernley  suggested that you would like to see the drafts as opposed to the final  copies, so I will have those forwarded to you today. The Sydney and  Singapore trip was a lengthy one, as it also involved a last leg of the trip  in London with regard to support for SIngapore. The Houston team returned  the middle of last week and worked with AA on an early draft last Friday. I  can also provide you with a draft of that report, the completion of which was  pending input from Bill Bradford early this week (he made the trip but was  out of the office last week). We did do a preliminary review of the Sydney  and Singapore findings with Rick Causey and Rick Buy on Friday afternoon, to  accommodate the fact that both are out on vacation this week.

This memo describes a coordination  role that I will play on certain operational policies and procedures that  should be coordinated in all trading locations. Please let me and/or Rick  know if you have any comments or suggestions. I had hoped to briefly discuss  this with you in person, as I would want you to understand two points:  (1)  This role will not prevent me from continuing a very strong focus on the  needs of ENA. I have worked very hard to assure a level of accuracy, control  and service in ENA operations. Through that hard work, I believe that I have  your confidence in my ability to deliver results. I  would do nothing to  jeopardize that. (2)  There is a need for this coordination function, and  some one will play that role. If I play that role, I can be in the best  position to influence outcomes with ENA's needs in mind. 3)   Gas Logistics:  I will talk with Whalley about my thoughts on this, but  I had wanted to make you aware that Jeff Shankman believes that he wants  logistics to report to him. His stated reason to me is that he wants it to  ""look like power"". I had wanted to discuss with you your thoughts on what   the criteria should be on which we make that decision. I will propose to  Greg and Jeff that gas logistics should be located in direct proximity to the  regional traders in order to facilitate the flow of commercially viable  information about the pipes and capacity. ( We have that now for the Central  and West desks, and should be able to make this happen as the 32nd floor is  built out for gas.) I believe, however, that gas logistics should now report  to Brent Price, my business controller over gas for the East, Central and  West regions. Brent would then have operations truly front to back (risk,  confirmations, scheduling and invoicing) and he sits on 31 and works very  closely with Jeff. Also, Brent would be in the best position to ensure that  the logistics team meets requirements for timeliness and accuracy of  volumetric information so that we can achieve our target headcount reduction  in gas operations of 52 by year end 2000. Without a continuing focus in  logistics on the downstream information needs, I will be concerned about our  ability to deliver our projected cost savings. I also believe that Brent  will be in the best position to ensure minimal flash to actual variances. While Greg and Jeff were certainly both with ECT in 1996 when we had an  earnings hit as a result of flash to actual variances, I am not sure that  either one was involved closely enough to appreciate the need for a strong  front to back focus to prevent these problems, and that includes holding  logistics accountable for their part in this. I will let you know the outcome of my conversations with Greg and Jeff on  this issue.",Various Discussion Points,beck-s
243,_670.subject,"We are working very diligently to accommodate the need for space on the 30th  floor. Unfortunately, we are not able to do any major construction to  densify the floor during the next several months while Enron Property  Services is completing the build-out of levels 29, 31 and 32. In the mean  time, we are going to build out the window spaces on 30 to increase the  capacity on the floor. While these locations are not prime spots, people  will need to occupy them as our business continues to grow. Once the window  seats have been constructed (estimated to be 2-3 weeks), we will realign  groups on the floor and people will need to move once again. I am requesting your cooperation and patience to work with Lisa Cousino while  she works with space planners to coordinate the location of Energy Operations  personnel on the newly-constructed Commercial floors. Susan Harrison is  working with Lisa to manage the space planning on 30 during this transition  period. Chantelle Villanueva will be coordinating all moves of people and  equipment on the 30th floor. If there are any problems once a move has  occurred (i.e., missing or non-working phones, boxes, computer equipment,  printers, etc. ), please contact Chantelle at Ext. 3-6279 as she will also  coordinate the follow-up on all move-related items. If Chantelle is not  available, Maria Sandoval will be her backup. Maria can be reached at Ext. 3-5586. I would also appreciate your help in cleaning up the floor, including the  window spaces.

The Operations Product Control Team in its  early stages was focused primarily on making our transition to EnronOnline a  smooth one for operations. Much time was spent initially on the bridges  necessary between EnronOnline and our legacy systems. The role of the team  has evolved today to one that is intimately involved in the day-to-day   operations of EnronOnline. With this evolution, it makes sense to have  Sheri's team as an integral part of the larger EnronOnline team. Sheri's  team will continue to support other e-commerce initiatives, such as  Clickpaper, DealBench and CommodityLogic, so that we can leverage the  experience of her team and avoid duplication of internal infrastructure. Sheri, Andy and I met with Sheri's team yesterday to announce this  organizational realignment. Sheri has done a great job of leading the  Product Control Group over the past 14 months. Sheri is committed to see  that her team continues to work closely with Operations to ensure that any  changes in Enron's e-commerce businesses that may impact trading operations  are shared with us.

Anne believes that she may have been the one to introduce the term ""protocol""  into these discussions. To clarify, according to Anne, the ""protocol"" is not  anticipated to be a formal legal document. Instead, Anne envisions simply  e:mails or memos between Enron and AEP with regard to any sharing of  information, agreements on processes to be followed in the transition, etc. Operational details to be decided between Enron and AEP have been handled  exactly in that manner to date, with e:mails being sent from Bob Ball (Enron)  to Steve Jackson (AEP). Only critical changes to the Purchase and Sale Agreement will be formally  documented. Bob Hall identified the treatment of cash accounts in the  original Purchase and Sale Agreement as incorrect relative to cash flows for  gas to be delivered in the month of May. He has worked with Enron's treasury  group to establish the correct procedures and has worked with Sandi Braband  in Legal to document this change to the Purchase and Sale Agreement as an  Amendment to that agreement. As of today, Legal has completed revisions to  that amendment and Anne Koehler is sending it to Mary Perkins in Enron's  Treasury group for her review. Upon Mary's review, Anne will forward the  amendment to AEP for their review before final signatures. We devised this week a new format for incorporating the AEP-HPL transition  issues on which my team has been focused and have provided that to both of  you.

Commercialization Efforts - Consulting:  Bjorn Hagelman in the RAC group made  a presentation at the Risk Forum luncheon last week outlining a plan for  providing risk consulting services to external customers. Some of his ideas  overlap the ideas around consulting that we fleshed out in our Dallas  meeting. Some of his ideas included providing services from my risk  operations team. I want this to be a concerted and not disjointed effort. Bjorn's vision is to create an Enron sub that will be the consulting  company. Our team in Dallas saw wisdom in partnering with an  accounting/consulting firm - established marketing arm, existing customer  contacts, proven consulting skills, depth of resources, etc. There could be  a play to get a hefty sum up front from a consulting firm to partner with us  - we impart our risk knowledge, they get the edge in the marketplace from  pairing with us, we take our upfront payment, they do most of the grinding  work - not necessarily a bad model. Bjorn seems to be in a hurry, as he has  identified a shipping company in Europe that is in need of risk consulting  and is ready to pay. Probably okay for him to start this effort in that  way. Prove concept, and then we can consider the wisdom of partnering with  someone else. I spent some time with him today. I want to be sure that he  doesn't commit my team to provide a service without our understanding and  being in agreement with the fee structure. We are okay for right now. I  will be following what Bjorn is doing and looking for ways to work together  if there is a good upside. I will keep you posted. Commercialization Efforts - Internal Marketing:  We have to change some  business practices within Enron and create a mind shift when originators are  selling operational services to their customers. We must price those and we  must have a mechanism for granting the appropriate income to Operations. Deal is in the works through power origination team - they priced our  services to customer without our involvement- pricing may not even be  sufficient to cover our costs. We are researching. To do's here are to  create an internal marketing document to review with lead originators and to  change DASH process so that Operations has a sign-off. I met with Louise  today on this. I will plan meetings with origination teams during the week  of March 19. Would love to get your input on our presentation to the orig  teams. I will get you a draft for your comments. Operational Risk:  Key focus this week has been on rebuilding a risk team in  Portland. Have worked with Stacey White (my power risk director) and Tim  Belden to make sure we have a short term and long term plan that will work. I am comfortable that we have devised a good plan. (We lost the manager of  that group last week - a planned move to London to follow her husband to an  Enron job there. Our unexpected change this week was the resignation Monday  of another risk book administrator from Portland.) Operational Risk:  Another key area that we are focusing on is the HPL sale. End of day today we will know which employees are going to AEP. We are  working on a smooth transition plan and how we will handle trailing issues  with customers after the sale effective date. We expect to eliminate 46  positions with the sale. This number was much larger earlier in the year  (around 70), but have had a lot of attrition with the news of the sale. Bob  Hall is focused on the details around this issue. Operational Risk:  We completed a Doorstep Review on the Monterrey office  last week. (This is the review of operational controls and procedures.) Went well - Max was skeptical about the process at first, but pleased in the  end. I will forward and e:mail to you from Max proclaiming his support of  these reviews. We overhauled this week the Doorstep Review schedule for the  remainder of the year and reviewed that today with Rick Causey. He likes the  revisions that we have made. Beth Apollo on my team is leading this effort. Spring Break Plans:  My children are on Spring Break the week of March 12 and  the nanny has the week off. We will be out of town through Wednesday, March  13 with the whole family looking at colleges for Meagan. Patti has contact  numbers for me if needed. I may decide to come back into the office on  Thursday and Friday. I will let Patti know when we get back in town. I will  either see you the end of next week, or back on Monday, March 19.

294,_867.subject,"Doorstep reviews are by design a quick look at commercial activities and the  mid and back office support for those activities in our wholesale  businesses. (EBS and EES will be included in 2001.) The controls around  mid and back office activities are best understood by conducting a deal test  - i.e. following the process and documentation around a series of  transactions from the inception of a deal through the collection of cash. Asking someone to explain their processes and controls is more the act of  explaining what we think happens. Doing a deal test tells us what does  happen. And it is when there are differences between the controls that we  believe to be in place and what actually happens, that we identify where  operational, and perhaps financial, risk is created. These reviews are not designed to replace the internal audit work for which  Enron has contracted with Arthur Andersen. As such, they are purposely  designed to be conducted in a shorter timeframe than AA's reviews and to  produce less paperwork. It is both the quick assessment of control gaps and  potential operational risk, and the quick solutions to correct these, that  are valuable in these reviews. These reviews also look  for ways to leverage  success stories from one office to another in terms of best in class  practices or practical solutions to shared problems. Briefly, the doorstep  review process would follow this set of steps:   1)  Cross-functional doorstep review team arrives at subject office. This  is usually unannounced, but key personnel in the subject office may be  notified of the review a few days prior to the team's arrival to be certain  that key individuals in that office will be not be out of town. 2)  Doorstep team lead will meet with the head of the subject office to tell  them about the parameters of the review and to ask their co-operation in  making information and personnel available to complete the review. 3)  The review is conducted, including information sessions with key  commercial personnel to understand the business conducted in the office and  key control/operations personnel to understand the business processes. The  deal test is conducted on a relevant sample of deals to verify the process  and controls that were followed in the life of the transactions. 4)  The doorstep team usually has a rough draft of key points by the end of  the review, which includes both controls that are working well and those  which may not be working as designed. Potential action items are suggested. This information is reviewed with the head of the office, as they are usually  very interested in knowing what can be done to improve controls to support  their business. There are times when the head of an office will suggest an  additional point to be added to the list of action items, knowing that with  this focus he/she can get help in accomplishing certain efforts to support  the growth of their business. The doorstep team lets the head of the office  know to whom this information will be communicated and the timing for doing  so. 5)  Starting late in 2000, the findings from doorstep reviews would next be  reviewed with Ted Murphy and me. Ted's viewpoint would be from Risk Controls  and mine from the mid and back office operations point of view. Ted and I,  assisted by Cassandra Schultz and Shona Wilson, would work with appropriate  personnel in the subject offices to understand who would assume  responsibility for addressing action items noted from the doorstep review and  to determine the appropriate time period for completing these action items. Then on a quarterly basis, Ted and I would meet with Rick Buy and Rick Causey  to give them a recap of doorstep reviews completed during that quarter,  doorstep findings that had been handled, updates on any outstanding doorstep  findings and plans for the next quarter. Through most of 2000, the doorstep  teams met with Rick and Rick within a few days of returning from each  doorstep review. This immediate feedback step was passed to Ted and me  sometime late in 2000. We did agree that we would meet with Rick and Rick  before the quarterly review if certain doorstep findings were of particular  concern or if we felt that they needed to be informed on an issue in a more  timely manner than quarterly. Steps 1 through 4 were followed in the review of the scrap metals business in  Germany. Shona did conduct a debriefing session with the managing directors  in charge of the scrap metal business. Her impression was that they were not  concerned over the length of time that it was taking to implement the  integration plan nor over the somewhat irregular payment methods that were  discovered during the deal test that are not in keeping with Enron's  practices. Shona also debriefed with Mike Jordan, and I believe that Fernley  was involved in that session as well. At my suggestion, she also contacted  Joe Gold to inform him of her findings. I do not know what the timing was  for Joe to get back to Shona, relative to Rick Buy's e:mail message. Michael, I understand that you may have felt blind-sided by the e:mail from  Rick Buy on his concerns over the scrap metal business. And if that was the  case, I apologize for that. While Shona did debrief with Mike and Fernley, I  know that she did not review the teams findings directly with you. If you  would like to be included in a direct debriefing with the doorstep team when  they review businesses that are managed by EEL, we can certainly add that as  a clear step from this point going forward. The out of the ordinary step in  this doorstep review was Shona's call to Rick Buy and Rick Causey to alert  them to the doorstep team's concerns over irregular payment methods and the  level of interest in controls that she perceived from the commercial managing  directors. I attribute that to a miscommunication between Shona and  myself. Although we had changed the process at year end so that the  download after doorstep was to be with Ted and me, as Shona and I voice  mailed back and forth she thought that I had asked that she initiate a  meeting with Rick and Rick. This meeting should have been with Ted and me. In leaving a voice mail for the two Rick's about setting up a meeting, Shona  mentioned some concerns. Rick Buy is the one that called her back and asked  for more detail. She definitely covered both the teams findings and the  integration plan that was underway with Rick Buy. We don't, however, control  which points Rick chooses to focus on or those to which he chooses to react. To reiterate, the findings from these doorstep reviews are shared with the  heads of the subject offices at the close of the reviews. The effort here is  to help identify control issues that could create risk to a business and to  offer solutions and resources that may be available from across the entire  Enron organization. The key is quick discovery and quick resolution. The  findings create a dialogue between the business units, RAC and Operations,  which I believe is healthy. We purposefully have chosen not to  ""over-wordsmith"" the findings or to delay discussing concerns that can be  surfaced through these reviews. Frankly, I believe that these reviews can  reveal things that are sometimes missed in AA's reviews from a practical  perspective and afford us the opportunity to mitigate operational risk. I would be glad to discuss any details of the doorstep review process with  you. We certainly want you to be informed and to view this process as  valuable input for you in managing EEL's business. Mike Jordan and certain  members of his team will be involved with doorstep reviews for other  businesses outside EEL later in the year. We are certainly open to any  suggestions you may have on getting the most out of this process.",Doorstep Review Process,beck-s

If you need more time to file your return, you can  easily get a filing extension. And if you can't afford to pay your tax bill now,  you can buy more time to pay up. While you may be                            subject to interest and penalties for payments  made after April 16, you can put off the day of                            reckoning for months without fear that IRS  collection agents will come after you. There is even a                            loophole in the law that will enable many  individuals to get an extra month to pay up without being                            assessed interest or penalties. Nevertheless, April 16 is a critical deadline for  anyone who has yet to file his tax returns. You'll need                            to file either your tax return or an extension  request by the deadline. And to avoid interest and                            penalties, you'll generally need to pay any taxes  owed by April 16. April 16 is also the deadline for making IRA  contributions for 2000 returns and for making the first                            installment of quarterly estimated taxes for 2001. Filing extension: If you'd like more time to file  your return, getting a filing extension is simple. In fact,                            the IRS has expanded the options this year for  obtaining a filing extension. You can now do it by                            phone, computer or mail.",Income Tax - Information,brawner-s

I answered that the bankruptcy was a result of overpaying for Wyoming deal  and low commodity prices last two years which resulted in a bb decrease below  outstanding.

Performance: Project completed with final tranche of results reported to Finance Committee  Dec 11.

Also, a  template and process has been established to be able to easily report changes  in the future. Enron has never had a comprehensive review of FX exposure  prior to this activity. As an aside, there has been a fair amount of hedging  activity resulting from this effort. Goal: Establish risk and trading control processes for risks unique to EES. Performance: Systems have been established and monitoring controls are in place across  EES. A thorough study of the DSM business has been completed and the results  presented to the Finance Committee. A RAC task force has been put in place  which has established a work plan consisting of 53 elements that EES has  agreed to put in place to get the overall back office and trading and credit  control systems where they need to be. Significant progress has been made  against these recommendations. DSM projects have been spot tested with  outside measurement firm and the results reported to EES. These tests have  highlighted focus areas to determine where the capital dollars are best  employed. Goal: Solidify the global risk management policy beyond Houston and London. Performance: Complete and Ongoing. During 2000, Project Doorstep was initiated by RAC  which inspected every office within Enron to determine if trading was taking  place and if so whether the Enron controls were being adhered to. A data base  system was developed to routinely prompt surprise inspections of these  offices and also monitor if the recommendations are being adhered to.

""De-silo-ization"" . - All existing reporting relationships remain unchanged, for the moment. - Successful implementation of this effort will require a positive attitude  among the teams. - Existing RAC responsibilities remain in effect. -  Teams should meet weekly, at least, to discuss issues. Transactions will  require more frequent informal meetings. - There are no excuses for forgetting to consider the impact on a deal of  credit, market risk or our portfolio. - All team members are responsible for all aspects of a transaction. Offer to  help out if needed. - If formal cross-training is necessary, force it to happen. - Encourage weak links in team to perform. - Each quarter RAC management will conduct portfolio reviews of the business  unit with the team present. This may take one quarter to implement. - If it makes sense to sit together for logistical reasons try to arrange it  with your supervisor. - Individual performance on the teams will be strongly considered in the PRC  and compensation processes.

368,_117.subject,"Randy, this is a short summary of the environmental findings that were  identified during the records review conducted at the Corpus Christi Koch  facility offices on May 1st and 2nd of this year. All environmental records which were available in the file data room at the  Koch office  were reviewed. Assumptions were made that the environmental  records were complete for all assets included in the sale. Primary emphasis  was placed on those environmental issues which are normally associated with a  sale or purchase of assets dealing with distribution and transmission of  crude oil. In particular, pipeline and tank farms were the most critical  assets which were reviewed. Based upon the data review, the Koch assets were in compliance with the  following:    Air permitting, permit by rule, standard expemtions, recordkeeping and fee  payments were documented     NSPS recordkeeping and inspections for VOC control on large crude oil tanks  were documented     Oil Pollution Act-OPA 90 plans had been prepared and were up to date    SARA compliance and reporting had been completed    SPCC plans had been prepared for each site which qualified under 40 CFR 112    Spill reporting history and notifications to the state agency were  available for review     There are ongoing groundwater and soil remediation activities at one site  included in the asset for sale      (permits for the remediation activity is in place)    Hazardous waste notifications, annual reportings and fee payments were  documented  Based upon the above review, there were no issues which could be identified  which would be condsidered a major environmental limitation or would be a  considered a major environmental  liability. This statement is again based  upon the assumption that all environmental information was present in the  data room for the assets in question. It should also be stated that this  analysis of Koch's environmental compliance is based upon the fact that Koch  has not held back or provided false or misleading information or knowledge  during their presentation or informaiton contained in the facility files. Pending further development and interest of this potential purchase, a  recommendation is made to conduct a phase I due diligence and site visit to  each location to verify findings from the records review. Also, due to the  past history of Koch's operating practices, it is recommended that contract  conditions be implicitly stated that EOTT will not be held liable for  discoveries of past deficiencies or releases of contamination which have  occurred on any of the Koch assets purchased.","Environmental findings, Koch South Texas Records Review",campbell-l

I am not comfortable with basing  decisions for further investigations on such a shallow depth, in leau of the  fact that  many times water soluble constituents may horizonatlly move  vertically from surface shallow depths into the lower subsurface areas. This  is indeed the case for chromates. I based my recommendations for metal  concentrations on the federal RCRA Subtitle C hazardous waste target levels  for metals and evaluated  the TPH and BTEX levels with the  underground  storage tank guidlines for California. There were references to a 1989  document in the ""Baseline"" report for specific parameters, but there may have  been an update to target contamination level requirements since that date and  therefore, I used 10,000 ppm which is a general action level for most states  for total petroleum hydrocarbons. Again, I did not evaluate the mercury or  the loading rack issues. One last issue. As you know, identification of contamination is usually  accomplished by sight observations of visible contamination, knowledge of  processes and or history. Report results of the surface contamination do not  show there to be an immediate environmental concern. Due to the age of the  facility, there may be concerns which were not identified in the reports. However, based upon the locations of the preliminary samplings which were  conducted throughout the facility, it appears that the information presented  in the reports would be adequate to address suspected contamination at the  facility.","Additional Soil Investigations, North Coles Levee",campbell-l

She  was very cordial and appreciative concerning Transwestern's proactive efforts  to contact not only her office but all federal and state agencies  which may  have jurisdictional lands impacted by the project. Although the proposed  route of the pipeline corridor has not been firmly established, she did   offer some general, yet valuable information concerning the geographic area  which exists south of Flagstaff into roughly northern Phoenix. The area south of Flagstaff into Phoenix crosses of three major ecological  regions identified by the TNC with major biological diversity of plants and  animals. The TNC has completed published studies on two of the regions. The  TNC has requested that should this project be apporved, these publications be  used to assist in the environmental studies which will need to be completed  prior to construction and approval by FERC. To the south and east of  Flagstaff is a sensitive portfolio consisting of the Verde River which is of  ecologic interest due to the abundance of endangered fish and bird species  which live in and around the area of the River. This river could be  impacted by the pipeline due to its meandering in a southwesterly direction  across Arizona. I have contacted other state and federal governmental agencies, in addition  to the TNC, and all parties have expressed difficulity in assessing the  environmental impact of a project of this magnitude without knowing the  pipeline corridor route. Part of this concern is due to the extensive and  unique biological diversity of Arizona.

400,_18.subject,"With respect to the September 13, 1999 letter from Richard and Oreane Garcia  concerning pipeline integrity  and noise issues, Transwestern Pipeline  Company offers the following response:  Pipeline Integrity. With the construction of the evaporation ponds over  Transwestern's right of way and pipline, Transwestern has closely monitored  the potential for  impacts for the pipeline. This includes a more frequent  inspection of the pipeline conditions underlying the ponds by taking  potentiometric readings to verify that  corrosion is not present. Transwestern has also installed rectifiers to assist in eleminating the  potential of pipeline corrosion. As a DOT requirement, Transwestern has  cathodically protected the entire pipeline system with an external pipeline  coating to further ensure the integrity of the pipeline underlying the  evaporation ponds. The pipline safety  measures implemented by Transwestern  are designed to not only identify corrosion iimpacts to the pipeline system  at   the inception of detrimental impacts as a result of corrosion, but also  allow for long term stability and integrity  by conducting state of the art  monitoring and detection. Noise Issue. In the initial environmental assessment and study, Transwestern  conducted baseline surveys of the area to determine existing noise levels. This study was completed to assist Transwestern in the mitigation measures  which will be implemented after construction of the Gallup Compresso  Station. Pending completion of the facility, Transwestern will conduct post  noise studys to determine whether facility noise levels have increased above  those levels mandated by FERC. In the event of operational noise levels  exceeding the FERC regulatory level of 55 ldn, Transwestern is committed to  performing any and all  mitigation measures necessary to ensure that the post  noise level of the facility will not be above the level mandated by FERC. Decrepancy of trailer park residents. In the letter by Mr. Garcia, it was  stated that Transwestern's assessment of the number of residences in the  adjacent trailer park  was not 18 as had been stated in our original study,  but ""more like 35 trailers"". The number of mobile home residences currrently  in the trailer park may in fact be closer to 35. Transwestern's trailer park  residence count was taken in the winter of the year when the fluctuating job  market is normally down and the number of residences in the park was low. The transient nature of mobile home residences and the fluctuating job  economy of the area is probably a direct reflection of the up and down nature  of the residences. It should also be noted that during the time that the  trailer park count was made, the owner of the trailer park who is also the  operator of the evaporation ponds was experiencing major difficulties in the  operation of the  ponds and raw sewage  had overflowed the pond embankments  and  had resulted in the raw sewage ponding in the yards of many of the  trailer park residents. It was actually noted that many of the spaces  normally occupied by mobile homes had been vacated. This unsanitary  condition was also identified by the New Mexico Environment Department. The  NMED had implemented enforcement actions against the trailer park owner.",Garcia Response of the Proposed Gallup C/S,campbell-l

I have spoken to Roger Kohn about  all of these issues and the only one which may be a problem is with No. 2. He is checking on what the EPA can do about this. I have spoken to Arnold  Eisenstein about what we can do with the strict 25 ppmvd requriement for NOx  and CO and he has said that we can hold to the 25 ppm value by doing some  major gas recycling. This is a fuel waste and costly. Anyway, depending  upon how long this issue delays the issuance of the permit will undoubtably  determine whether we give in to the 25 ppmvd or hold out for 40 ppmvd. Id  like your comments asap. 1. The responsible official name change to  Danny Pribble. 2.. The draft permit limits NOx and CO emissions to  25 ppmv at 15% O2, based on a 3-hour average, except during periods of  startup   and shutdown. At 60F and above the GE data indicates that these  rates are achievable under all operating conditions. However, GE   data  indicates that NOx and CO may be as high as 40 ppmv during low-load  conditions of 60%and lower. The permit application represented turbine operations at base load 80% of  the time with reduced load operations (64% load) occurring  no more than 20%  of the time. The potential to emit calculations presented the emissions in  the application in units of lb.hr and ton/yr. These values were accepted by  the EPA for the netting analysis, and  took were taken into account by the  EPA (See EPA Statement  of Basis document). Because the permit conditions  hold us to ppmvd values and not lb/yr or ton/year values, Transwestern is    concerned that under low load conditions of less than 60%, the emissions of  NOx and CO would be 40 ppmvd. Transwestern is  requesting that  a provision  be made in the permit conditions that  emissions of NOx and CO be held to 40  ppmvd during the 20 % of  the time that the turbines operating conditions is  less than or equal to 60%. 3. The word ""Catepillar"" is mispelled throughout the permit. 4. Permit conditions for sulfur testing in the fuel gas requires Transwestern  to use methodologies (wet chemistry technology) that are not     normally  used to monitor and measure sulfur in the natural gas. Transwestern has  received approval from the EPA for other custom  fuel monitoring schedules to  use  ""GPA Standard 2377"" (length of stain tube) or gas chromatography as the  proposed methodology  to  monitor sulfur in the natural gas.",Staions 3 and 4 air permit comments to EPA,campbell-l
404,_197.subject,"Transwestern Pipeline Company  Transwestern has run into some problems with the air permit conditions for  the Redrock Expansion. For the state permits, the ADEQ wants to abitrarily  set a 10% safety factor to the emissions levels which approach PSD. This  means that they have written into the draft permit a reduction in the  allowable hours of operation for  the generator from 8760 to 7800. This  generator is the facility's prime source of power and therefore, needs to be  operated for 8760 hours. Transwestern will challenge the agency's authority  to apply a 10%safety factor. For the Indain lands permits, the EPA has written a permit condition of 25  ppmvd for NOx and CO under all operating conditions. Manufacturerers  guarantees only apply at 25 ppmvd at loads above 65% and at 0F. It appears  that Transwestern may have convenienced the EPA to back away from permit  limits in ppmvd and include as permit conditons lb/hr and ton/yr emissions  limits that Transwestern originally placed into its applications. Northern Natural Gas Company  A standard exemption for the NNG Martin Co. No. 1 facility was submitted to  the TNRCC.

410,_29.subject,"This is just a short update on the conference call just completed with  Michael Adewumi of Penn State, concerning the PCB pipeline modeling project  proposed for the Transwestern mainline system. David Roensch, Dr. Adewumi  and myself discussed the latest proposal submitted by Adewumi and based upon  his answers to the technical and operational questions, it appears that the  model will yeild some useful information. Adewumi was asked about the  simultaneous modeling of PCB's and arsenic and feels that the model can  address this situation. He felt that by initiating the model to the pipeline  segement  selected for the study (between C/S 4 and C/S3) this information  could be projected to the other pipeline segments with physical and  elevational conditions not represented in the segment selected. As is the  case with most projects of this nature, answers to some questions cannot be  addressed until we begin the process. It appears that the next step in this process is to have Mike Terraso contact  Michael Adewumi. David Roensch and I will be available to feed technical and  operational information to Adewumi for his modeling input. It may also be in  the best interest of this project  to see a team of technical and operational  experts from Enron and Transwestern begin a  brain stroming of this project  during the data input stage to address issues related to the field cleaning  trials, both of the pipeline system and the C/S piping. By working through  the process, we may be able to alleviate some potential concerns  and  increase the cleaning success. Although Transwestern has been involved in  this type of cleaning for a number of years, based upon the liquids data  results, the system has met with variable success. The more technical and  operational information we can incorporate into the model, the better will be  the modeling conclusions and results of the  cleaning activity.",Conference Cal with Adewumi,campbell-l

The state of Colorado perceives increased fuel use  beyond manufacturers values as the turbine not operating correctly and in  need of mechanical adjustment. From their eyes, this would be a strong  indication of excess emissions, and I think there evaluation would hold some  merit. Anyway, I dont want to send up a red flag to the state of Colorado.

Vector was instructed to use a high caustic detergent (Cimclean) as the  cleaning agent for removing PCB's from the Topock F/S (50:50 Cimclean:water  mixture). Diesel was not used in the deconning process. The only equipment  cleaned by Vector was the PG&E F/S. Transwestern's filters in its separator  were replaced,  but no cleaning or deconning was perfromed to this unit. The filters were also replaced in the PG&E separator. The following samples were collected during this project:  On the Transwestern side:   1. Wipes (3) of the interrior body of our filter separator after the filters  were removed. Large areas were wiped to determine presence/absence of    PCB's. (Not 100 sq. cm. sample)   2. A composite sample of a used filter removed from the upstream separator  at the Selexol Plant. The filters appeared to be exceptionally clean    3. Composite sample of the fine powdery rust  which had collected in the  bottom of the F/S. Approximte volume one cup. 4. Composite sample of the used filters from the F/S. Visible appearance of  the filters removed from this vessel showed them to be clean and    virtually  unstained. A small discoloration was present on the ends of each filter  confirming that the filters were sealed properly in the F/S. 5. A sample of an unused clean stocked filter. This was a control sample. On the PG&E side:   1. A liquids sample of the residual in the upstream leg of the Topock filter  separator prior to deconning. Approx. volume one cup   2. Sample of the solids (fine, blackened, powder) which had collected in the  F/S. An estimate of the volume of this material removed form the F/S   prior  to deconning was approximately one gallon. 3. Wipe samples (3) of the interrior of the F/S prior to deconning (not 100  cm sq. wipe)   4. Used filter media from the F/S. The operation of the F/S filters are  designed to be a twice pass through of the same filter. Composite samples    were collected of the upstream and downstream portions of the filters. 5. Wipes (3) of the deconned filter separator interrior walls. The only inconsistency observed during the cleaning and inspection process  was the volume and  buildup of the black fine powdery hydrcarbon material  which was present in the F/S at the Topock C/S and conspicuously small amount  of rust colored material which was present  in Transwestern's F/S . As  previously mentioned, samples were collected of  both materials. The only  difference between the two locations was the color of the materials and the  volume. It is suspected that the deconning activity conducted in August of  99 loosened hydrocarbon solids present in the 1850 feet of pipe which had  over time moved and collected in the PG&E F/S. The small amount of rust  materials observed in the Transwestern F/S is the result of the pigging  activity from the Selexol Plant into the Transwestern F/S. I will have  reprensentataive samples of both materials.

He stated  that they have seen reduced concentrations and are curious as to why this  trend is occurring (sounds like good news to me). He said that their data  shows the following:   1998 liquids concentrations  only 1% regulated at the federal level   1999 liquids concentrations only 8% regulated at the federal level  Ralph has requested that SoCal be allowed to collect a  liquids sample at the  Needles M/S and I have contacted the Needles team about assisting SoCal with  the collection. I would expect that this may have implications with respect to slight  increased billing for analytical charges that SoCal will be charging us for  and we reveiw on a quarterly basis with them.",PCB Study on the SoCal System,campbell-l
432,_68.subject,"Louie/John, this memo summerizes the results of the environmental due  diligence which was performed on the Texas Panhandle and Cortez, Colorado  portions of Equilon pipline system for which EOTT may be interested in  purchasing. This memo presents those environmental issues which may be or  were identified as a potential environmental concern. Lefors (Texas Panhandle Segment)  Assets on this portion of the system which may have environmental  issues  were the following:  1-80,000 bbl. liquids product storage tank, 41 small  tank batteries consisting of 1-3 product storage tanks each. Average tank  size is 210 bbl. Approximately 15 tank locations are within 1/4 mile of an  existing waterway. There are stream and river crossings included in this  package. The pipeline crossings viewed appeared to have sufficient  soil  coverage and did have block valves on the upstream and downstream portions of  the pipeline crossings. 1. Clean Air Act. There were no records kept at any office or location which  would assist in the determination of compliance with Title III, or Title V.   The  following documents were not present:  emissions inventories and or  records of fees paid, O&G MACT compliance (HAP's),  operating permits. NSPS   Supart Kb compliance could not be determined also. The 80,000 bbl tank  construction date was in the 1930's and has a fixed roof. It has a concrete   bottom and the  tank has never been emptied for inspection. No  Railroad  Commission 653 inspection has ever been conducted. 2. Clean Water Act. Although soil berm and containments were present around  all tanks that were inspected, SPCC plans were not available at any  location. Interviews with the Equilon personnel stated that there had never  been a reportable release from this tank. In addition, location Texaco MB   Davis pump  station had a small 3'x4' UST which received liquids from leaking  packing material which had overflowed and visible soil staining was present. At this  location a T-stand pipe had been constructed into the soil berm to  allow discharge of rainwater from the containment area. This water  discharged into  an ephermal arroyo which ultimately collects into the North  Fork of the Red River, a perennial stream. 3. NESHAPS. At the Lefors Station, there exists several joints of new and  used pipe which is suspected of having external coating and pipe wrapping    containing asbestos. 4. NORMS. A NORM survey has not been conducted on any portion of the assets  which are identified in the bid package. 5. Soil Staining. There was minor soil staining at all locations inspected. 6. There is one active groundwater remediation in progress identified as the  ""10 mile hole"". Equilon will retain ownership of this issue. There had been  two  pipeline remediation projects for which Equilon had reported to the TRRC  and had remediated the site. 7. TSCA. One electrical transformer was discovered at the Lefors Station. It had been tested and determined to not have PCB's. 8. Safe Drinking Water Act. There was an abandoned drinking water well at  the Lefors Station.

433,_69.subject,"I want to bring interrested parties up to date on the issue of replacing the  fuel mixers with carbuerators at  the Spraberry Plant. It seems that this  replacement was performed ONLY as a fuel savings activity and that there  would be no increase in emissions or horsepower as a result. According to  the TNRCC, they will allow this activity provided that the above is true and  that we prove that emissions and horsepower will not increase. To do this  they have requested that we conduct an emissions test on one of the units  with the mixer on and then with the carbuerator on as a condition of their  approval. IE before and after testing. I am going to request that we be  allowed to do the testing with a portable emissions tester, which has been  verified in side by side testing on New Mexico units as opposed to bringing  in a third party referenced testing company. Contractor testing runs about  $3-5,000. A condition of all permitting issues is that the carbs are not supposed to be  installed on the units (preconstruction) until approval has been given by the  agency. In this case, we will be allowed to install a carbuerator on the one  unit to be tested but not on all units. Should testing show other  exceedances (emissions or Hp) in addition to fuel savings, this will trigger  actions requiring perimtting. Under the circumstances, I think it would be  in the best interest of NNG to know for certain that we have not violated the  grandfather status of the units and that if our activity requires permitting,  we comply immediately. I am sending out the letter request to the TNRCC today. If approved, we  should test ASAP. Remember, that sampling ports in the exhaust stack of the  unit to be tested will need to be constructed prior to testing. Let me know  if the Team will need a diagram showing the sampling port locations.","Ignition System Spraberry Plant, Permit Status",campbell-l

440,_80.subject,"I wanted to present this summary of the meeting Transwestern had with  representatives of the Laguna Pueblo concerning the status of the PCB  remediation activities by TW. On the Laguna side were members of the Laguna  pueblo, the PEOP a  technical oversight group that provides expertise and  assistance on technical issues for all of the 19 pueblos in New Mexico  (ranging from UST to superfund), and members of ETS ( 5 members of the Laguna  team, Butch Russell, Rick Smith  (advisor for the Laguna team), myself)  and  George Robinson. This is the third meeting we had in the last year and a  half with this group since the Lagunas have started showing renewed interest  in environmental activities on their pueblo. The meeting centered around two issues at the site: the closure of the UST  and the PCB remediation activity. With respect to the first, concensus was  reached that we would continue monitoring and collecting groundwater samples  at the two downstream well locations from the UST site on a quarterly basis,  and send the results to POEP for review. With repsect to the PCB remediation issue, things were a little different. The POEP representatives expressed concern on behalf of the Laguna tribal  Coucil that the progress of the remediation activities Transwestern is  presently using to bring closure to the site is not showing positive goals  toward  achieving cleanup at the site and that the data submittals to the  Lagunas have verified this. They indicated that that have been patient with  Transwstern's attempts to allow natural attenuation to reduce the PCB  contamination, but based upon the historic sampling results, that this  technology is not proving to be very successful, in fact the results have  shown stagnant results  (Im using their words). They would like to see  Transwestern implement other more proactive technologies to arrive at cleanup  and closure of this site. Members of the Laguna pueblo, who work for the  POEP,  expressed concern that the PCB contamination could negatively impact  future generations of Lagunas members and that it was the responsibility of  Transwestern to clean up the contamination which they brought onto their  lands. One member of the Laguna pueblo called the contamination a ""cancer""   with potential to spread. A comment was made by the POEP that there was a  major potential of increasing the magnitude and spread of the contamination  if we continue to just maintain  our present approach of just monitoring the  site and installing additional wells..  A member of the POEP has been in contact with a consortum of individuals from  North Dakota State University, (Energy and Environmental Research Center) who  claim to be experts in reclamation of contaminated sites which are considered  difficult to remediate (this site would certainly fall into this category due  to the presence of the sandstone bedrock which has numerous cracks and  channels present which direct  the PCB containing liquids present at the  site). Although the POEP was not recommending Transwestern utilize their  service, they did strongly suggest that we should at least discuss this site  with them. It shold also be mentioned that Syed Risvi, the POEP Superfund representative  was at this meeting. He had mentioned that the  POEP has been in discussions  with EPA Region VI concerning potential classification of the site on the  CERCLIS list of sites for inclusion on the NPL.. He had indicated that he  did not want to see this site included on the list, but stated that  Transwetern needed to update and show postive results in our remediation  efforts and that it was the tribal councils opinion that this was not being  done. At the conclusion of the meeting, I informed the POEP that Transwestern's  internal remediation group  would contact the NDSU group and discuss the site  characteristics with them and we would reprot back to them the results of our  discussions. This seemed to satisify the  POEP and they were content with  this. John, I would like to schedule a conference call with the above list of  people and discuss this issue. A couple of things I want to bring out. First, we will be undergoing ROW and Compressor Station renewals with the  Lagunas in the near future. Second, on the Laguna tribal lands, they have  experienced other releases of contimation and are currently very sensitive to  this whole  contamination problem. Although we are considered by the POEP as  proactive up to this point  and very easy to work with (direct quote from the  POEP)   they are wanting a more proactive and measurable effort from  Transwestern to clean up the PCBs. Please get back with me on this.",Meeting with the Laguna's over the PCB remediation at C/S 6,campbell-l

482,_384.subject,"Anne,  I have reviewed the P&S Agreement for Triple Lutz. From my perspective, it  generally looks fine. I have a few comments, and invite Pat Mackin to add  any he may have, in particular based on his review of Section 4.14. In Section 4.7(c)(iv), there is a reference to any contract obligations. I  believe this would include employment contracts, which do not appear to be  identified specifically on any schedule unless the annual amount exceeds  $250K. We may want to clarify that the disclosures are consistent with the  provisions of Section 4.13(iii). Section 4.8 provides that we will not enter into any employee benefits not  required by law. However, given that closing is pushed out so far in the  future, we may want the flexibility to provide incentive bonuses for key  personnel to stay with the company through closing. This may be done with  the Buyer's consent, but we may be tying our hands. Section 6.2(e) contains  a similar restriction on making payments to officers/directors. In addition, Section 4.8 states that we won't enter into or amend any  employment contracts. We do not renew employment contracts at a single time,  and the contracts of key personnel may expire. Do we want to tie our hands  and be prohibited from amending/extending the agreements? Section 6.2(l)  also prohibits the modification/amendment of contracts with employees. In Section 4.10, the wording ""(other than Environmental Laws)"" suggests that  we are not in compliance with environmental laws. Rephrasing that sentence  to refer to the provision of the Agreement may be preferable. In Section 4.11(d), we promise that we haven't provided any gift of any kind  to customers. I don't think we can say that, given that we regularly host  client development outings (e.g. Rodeo BBQ tickets, golf tourneys, etc.) and  provide Enron goodies to people all the time. Perhaps a limitation on de  minimus gifts would be more accurate. Also, a reference to our Code of  Ethics may work here. In Section 4.13(a)(iii), does the $250K threshhold include only cash value,  or does it include equity grants that vest over time? A reference to ""cash""  payments would clarify, given that people here are compensated by stock  options/restricted stock that vest over time.

514,_1002.subject,"Business&Finance: ESB ownership of network is questioned - Competition  Authority says separation of national grid from core company does not go far  enough. Arthur Beesley reports     11/13/2000  Irish Times  18  Copyright (C) 2000 Irish Times; Source: World Reporter (TM)   The Competition Authority has questioned the ESB's ownership of the  electricity network in the newly deregulated power market. In a paper submitted to the Department of Public Enterprise, the body said  the separation of the ESB's National Grid operation from the core company did  not go far enough to ensure fair competition. It said arguments in favour of the ESB retaining the transmission and  distribution system ignored the 'overwhelming conclusion' that a generation  company which owns such assets 'will naturally favour itself' at the expense  of customers and reliability. The paper has not been published yet. It is believed to state, however, that  the ESB's retention of its 'non-competitive' transmission and distribution  assets and its 'competitive' electricity generation business was unwise from  a competition perspective. The National Grid, which controls when individual power stations feed  electricity into the network, was separated from the ESB when 27 per cent of  the market was opened last February. In theory, this meant the ESB could not favour its own generation stations  over more efficient competitors when deciding which plant to switch on and  off as demand for power fluctuates. But the authority's response to the Statutory Instrument behind the  separation - which renamed the National Grid as Eirgrid - said more should be  done to ensure the market operates fairly. The paper said: 'Some argue that as long as there is an independent operator  of the underlying transmission system, ownership of the transmission system  can remain in the hands of an upstream generation operator. 'In accordance with this line of argument, the shift of operational control  of electricity transmission to Eirgrid would mean that discrimination in  dispatch [of power] and other operations would not be possible. However, the  Competition Authority considers that this argument ignores the overwhelming  conclusion that the generation company that owns the transmission lines will  naturally favour itself.' The Statutory Instrument followed complex talks, which led to an agreement  between the ESB, its trade unions and the Minister for Public Enterprise, Ms  O'Rourke. When Eirgrid was formed, the ESB retained ownership and responsibility to  develop and maintain the high-voltage national transmission system and the  low-voltage local distribution network. The authority says these, too, should be separated from the ESB to ensure the  competitive market functions fairly, according to a person familiar with its  paper. This would ensure equal access to the power network and an objective,  transparent, non-discriminatory treatment of all electricity generators in  the market, it said. The paper argues the ESB has an incentive to allocate as many costs as  possible to the operation of the transmission and distribution system.

528,_11755.subject,"PLEASE KEEP THIS NOTE, AND THE INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THE NOTE CONFIDENTIAL. As folks are aware, we have been engaged in closed-door negotiations for the  past two weeks regarding a possible market-based solution to California's  electricity crisis. In the room are the major large customer groups, environmentalists, small  customers (TURN), Independent Energy Producers, labor, the Western States  Petroleum Association, and Enron. The negotiations were convened by the Speaker of the Assembly (Bob Hertzberg). When Hertzberg convened the meeting, he told the parties that he wanted to  achieve a core/noncore structure, similar to the structure in place in  California's gas market (i.e., large customers are required to buy gas from  the market, with Direct Access available to all other customers). In effect, ""core"" customers (rez and small business) would be served by the  utilities' retained generating assets and QF contracts; and large customers  would go to market. The core/noncore structure would begin 1.1.03. The negotiating group has struggled over the past two weeks, but is close  devising a framework for core/noncore in Californis (but who pays for the  utilities' past debts and the costs of DWR power purchased between January  and today remain very contentious). Unfortunately, with the release of the information regarding the DWR  contracts last Friday, it is now clear that achieving a core/noncore  structure will be very difficult unless something is done to mitigate the  contracts. The problem is that, if core is served by utility gen and QFs, and large  customers are in the market, there is no (or very little) need for the DWR  contracts. Instead, they look like a signficant stranded cost. Hertzberg and the negotiating group are looking to Enron for creative ways to  address ""the DWR contract problem"" in order to prevent the contracts from 1)  killing the core/noncore deal and 2) forcing California to accept a structure  focused on a state power authority headed-up by David Freeman that does not  include Direct Access. Christian Yoder and Steve Hall are reviewing the contracts to analyze any  ""out clauses"" that the buyer and/or the seller might have under the contract  provisions. (My cursory review of the contracts suggests that ""outs"" for the  state are minimal or nonexistent.) In addition, we've started batting around ideas about how the State might  reform the contracts. All this said, want to let everyone know that we have made it extremely clear  that Enron fundamentally opposes any and all attempts to unilaterally  abrogate anyone's contract rights. We'd like to have a quick call tomorrow (30-60 minutes) to brainstorm some  options that we can offer Hertzberg to handle the contracts and keep the  core/noncore solution alive. We'd like to try to have the the call at 1 PM  PDT. Please let me know if this works for you, and if it doesn't, please let  me know if there's a time after 1 PM PDT that works for you.

536,_11868.subject,"Hertzberg (speaker of the CA Assembly) called a meeting yesterday afternoon  of the group of market participants that have been negotiating the  ""core/noncore"" proposal in California. The purpose of the meeting was to  brief us on their activities and their gameplan for trying to find a solution  for California. Here's a summary of the meeting. Please keep confidential. Work will be done over the weekend to put the core/noncore proposal in  legislative language. (We will be in the room.) Work done by the ""Plan B"" group in the Assembly (Joe Dutra and Joe Nation)  will also be put into legislative language over the weekend. Because no proposal is ""comprehensive,"" a complete legislative package will  be created from the various pieces that have been worked on thus far (i.e.,  core/noncore, ""Plan B,"" Edison MOU) In addition, there are Republican demands that Hertzberg will need to address  (e.g., end the litigation) in order to achieve bi-partison support, which is  what Hertzberg's shooting for. To move the legislation, the plan is to establish a ""conference committee,""  comprised of an equal number of Democrats and Republicans. The committe would begin work on Monday and would attempt to finish putting a  comprehensive bill together, vote it out of the Legislature and send it to  the Governor for signing by Monday, July 16th. July 16th is the deadline because that is the date that the PUC will issue  its proposed decision regarding, among other things, how DWR's revenue  requirement will be put into rates, whether Direct Access needs to be  suspended, etc. The PUC is issuing the draft on the 16th in order to give everyone 30 days to  review and comment before the Commission votes on a final order on August  15th. (The PUC will actually issue a ""thought piece"" on Monday the 9th and  will use reactions to the ""thought piece"" to craft the develop the proposed  decision it plans to issue on the 16th.) All of this is still up in the air, however.

(changes 1st paragraph, adds details, company statement)  SAN JOSE, Calif., July 6 (Reuters) - Independent power generator Calpine  Corp. said on Friday that its contracts with Pacific Gas and Electric Co.  will be altered, ensuring that Calpine will continue to supply power to the  bankrupt California utility and that it will get paid more than $250 million  for power already sold. Calpine stocks rose more than 14 percent, or more than $5, to $43 after the  announcement. As part of the contract modification, the $267 million, with interest, that  the utility, a unit of PG&E Corp , owes Calpine in past due receivables under  the contracts, will be elevated to ""administrative priority status,"" a claim  which is paid before any other general unsecured creditors. Calpine will get the money, in a lump sum, as soon as PG&E has a confirmed  reorganization plan, which can take as long as four to six months from now,  Calpine said. The move is also a step in the process of untangling California's energy  crisis, which stemmed from a flawed deregulation plan that has hit the state  with a series of rolling blackouts. Under the agreement, Calpine will continue to receive its contractual  capacity payments, but it has also set up a fixed rate contract for the next  five years of about 5.37 cents per kilowatt-hour. The contracts are known as qualifying facility contracts because Calpine's  power plants are qualifying facilities. These types of facilities represent  more than 20 percent of the state's power supply and sell power generated  from renewable energy sources to the regulated utilities. ""Calpine is the first power company to modify its QF contract with PG&E to  ensure that Northern California consumers will continue to benefit from these  affordable and reliable energy resources,"" Calpine senior vice president  James Macias said in a statement.",PG&E utility gives Calpine debt priority status.,dasovich-j

As expected, some in the group are attempting to ""recontract"" certain  portions of the original deal, but those attempts are generally at the margin. The DWR contracts remain a key impediment to any deal. Senator Burton has still not definitively committed to a conference committee  to produce a bill to deliver to Davis. In addition, the legislation to create a dedicated rate component to service  the bonds to repay the state budget for power purchased by DWR (and de-link  the bonds from the DWR contracts) may be on a slower track than folks thought  initially.

547,_120.subject,"Talked to Dave. In a nut shell, here are the problem areas in the bill as he  sees it. It was a very brief conversation, but I think I've captured the key  points: Based on an expectation that the ""expedited siting"" bill would help site  plants, Dave's group had six plants on the drawing board. The 5 ppm requirement kills 4 of the 6, i.e., the 4 can't meet the 5 ppm  requirement. The requirement that the plants would either be 1) shut down after 3 years or  2) replaced with a combined-cycle plant kills the other 2 because a) shutting  down the plants in 3 years kills the economics, and b) the sites for the two  LM-6000s can't accomodate combined cylces (i.e., Dave couldn't get siting). In addition,the generator would be required to sign an exclusive with the ISO  (which the EOB would have to approve), which takes away the optionality of  going to the market, thus killing the economics. On the labor side, it's complicated, but in essence, by requiring that ""...it  be shown that the applicant has a contract with a general contractor and has  contracted for an adequate supply of skilled labor to construct, operate, and  maintain the plant,""  it forces Dave to negotiate a labor deal before he knows what the project is  (i.e, before the project has been approved), and, it effectively prevents Enron from having the option to use internal  resources (this issue is very specific to Enron; I can explain more if folks  prefer). In short, bullets 1-3 would seem to affect both Enron and the market, while  the last bullet is, according to Dave, very Enron specific. Point 2 in  bullet 4, according to Dave is sensitive and should not be made public. If any questions, let me know.

As you know, Enron's been involved with a group of business customers, small  customers, labor and enviros trying to hammer out a core/noncore proposal  that would act as a key modification to Edison's MOU with the Governor. Today, the Assembly leadership released a bill (AB 82XX) that modifies the  MOU but does not follow the core/noncore proposal negotiated by the group. The bill just came out, is about 80 pages long, and thorough analysis has not  yet been completed. The URL for the bill is attached. Based on a meeting  attended this morning in Sacramento,the key features of the bill( which is  attached) are:  Direct Access suspended until 1.1.2003 (suspension presumably effective on  the effective date of the bill) Transmission sale at 2X book. Approximately 90% (or greater) of Edison's undercollection absorbed by  customers 20KW and above. Create a Trust to address the money owed to the generators and offer the  generators 70 cents on the dollar (but does not do away with the suits,  investigations, etc.) The bill is completely silent regarding who will pay for the DWR contracts  and what the payment structure will look like. Reaction and Timetable Very chaotic, with considerable uncertainty about where (if anywhere) the  bill will go, leaving many to believe that bankruptcy remains a strong  possibility. Business customers (and of course Enron) are strongly opposed Republicans are strongly opposed Labor has big problems with the Tx sale unless they get assurances that TX  labor jobs are guaranteed, which is not yet included in the bill We are working with business to remove the Direct Access suspension We are also working on the Senate side to attempt to get the Senate to  include Direct Access in their version of the modified MOU, but the Senate  has been more hostile than the Assembly to Direct Access. Senate Democrats still intend to run a bill that delinks payment of the bonds  to repay General Fund for power already purchased from the DWR contracts. AB82XX does not address this issue. Senate Democrats also intend to craft their own version of a ""modified MOU."" Word is that the Senate will release their bond language and their ""modified""  MOU this weekend or early next week.

Although Houston-based Enron owns no major power plants in California, it has  adopted the toughest stance of all energy companies against the multiple  investigations of why wholesale energy prices spiked so high. And it has  become, in turn, a whipping boy for California politicians.

563,_12133.subject,"Bizarre as it sounds, we've now heard that they are calling the Assembly  members back. So it appears that the Assembly leadership will at least make  a run at this. We are getting more information and mobilizing industry. Some key considerations:  The Governor is putting immense pressure on the Legislature to get something  done. The Legislature is fearful of getting blamed by the Governor for having ""done  nothing."" Becauase the Assembly has thus far ""done nothing,"" the only thing it has in  front of it is 78. The Assembly could not agree to the Speaker's bill because it felt the bill  was too far to the left; but 78 is even more one-sided. So there's a  reasonable likelihood that 78 would have to be amended considerably in order  to get the support necessary to get voted out. Once voted out of the Assembly, it would have to go back to the Senate, where  the Senate would have to approve it. Again, the Senate has adjourned, so Burton would have to round them up and  call them back for a vote, and there's no indication at this time that  Burton's inclined to come back. In addition, Burton has said that he's not interested in making any changes  to 78, that ""it's 78 or nothing."" Consequently, for the Sentate (i.e.,  Burton) to vote it out, it would first have to agree to the Assembly's  amendments. Thus far, the Assembly and the Senate have not seen eye to eye  on the issues. All that said, this Legislature is far from rational, and nothing can be  counted out. We're therefore operating under the assumption that 78 could  move. Will report back as information becomes available. Best,",Rumor That The Legislature May Reconvene,dasovich-j
564,_12139.subject,"Adding to Kristin's update, here's the summary of a meeting that just occured  with Assembly leadership staff and industry on the Assembly's latest version  of an ""Edison MOU"":  The Speaker's staffer said that if he had to bet at this time, he would bet  that the Assembly would not convene on Friday. He also said that, if it doesn't happen on Friday, nothing will happen until  they get back from recess on the 20th of August. The Assembly will let folks know by tonight or first thing tomorrow whether  they intend to move forward with a vote on Friday or recess. From the most recent proposal released today by the Assembly leadership, it  appears that the centrist Democrats are prevailing. The proposal: Retains Direct Access (though they said that they are continuing to be  pressured by the Treasurer, who wants DA suspended due to the bond issuance) Places 80% of Edison's past debt with large customers (leaving 20% with small  customers, which business customers or strenuously opposing). Eliminates all references to any purchase, or option to purchase, Edison's  transmission. (They said there simply ain't the votes to buy, or consider  buying, Edison's transmission in the Assembly) Maintains the Senate provision, which would pay the banks, pay the QFs, but  place with Edison the risk of figuring out how to pay the $1billion owed to  suppliers. (Even the munis are begining to complain about those provisions.) Creates a tradeable, renewable portfolio standard (conceptually similar to  the one created in Texas). The new bill is created by 1) amending SB78 and 2) gutting a different bill  passed from the Senate to the Assembly, SB39, and replacing it with the new  version of 82XX. The two would go together to create the Assembly's newest  proposal. If this bill gets voted out of the Assembly, it will likely have a difficult  time getting the votes necessary to pass in the Senate, since the Senate has  considered and rejected several provisions currently included in the Assembly  version.

568,_12214.subject,"Gouger Gray Davis  California's petulant governor ignores reality as he overpays for electricity  LANCE T. IZUMI Mr. Izumi is a senior fellow in California Studies at the San  Francisco- based Pacific Research Institute. On the surface, things seem to be going pretty good for Gov. Gray Davis with  regard to California's electricity crisis. The governor has scored some nice  publicity by switching on some new power plants. The weather has been  unseasonably cool. His poll numbers are edging back up. Yet beneath this  optimistic picture lie troubling problems. For example, Davis's argument that  out-of-state power generators are responsible for the electricity crisis has  been falling apart. For months, Davis has been claiming that private  generators have overcharged California by $8.9 billion and demanded that this  amount be refunded to the state. However, after a two-week mediation between  state officials and the generators, Curtis Wagner, the federal government's  chief energy regulatory judge, rebuked Davis's claim saying that such a huge  overcharge ""has not and cannot be substantiated."" Further, while the  generators may be liable to refund a much smaller amount to the state,  perhaps $1 billion, Wagner said that generators are owed more money by the  state than they owe the state in refunds: ""Can a cash refund be required  where a much larger amount is due the seller? The chief judge thinks not."" Davis reacted to the judge's ruling by calling it a ""raw deal"" and by urging  the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to ignore the lack of evidence and  the judge's conclusions and to ""step up and provide the refunds we've asked  for."" Davis's position, as usual, is motivated purely by politics. Indeed,  Dan Walters of the Sacramento Bee says that Davis is operating in a  ""melodramatic virtual world"" de-linked from reality. Davis's blame-the-generators argument took another body blow when newly  released documents showed that, on average, major out-of-state power  companies such as Enron, Duke, Dynergy and Mirant charged less than the  average prices paid by the state during the first three months of the year. California government utilities, on the other hand, such as the Los Angeles  Department of Water and Power and the Sacramento Municipal Utility District  (SMUD), charged the state much more for electricity than the out-of-state  generators. For example, while Texas-based Enron, a favorite Davis whipping  boy, charged an average $181 per megawatt hour, SMUD charged an average $330  per megawatt hour. Davis responded to this revelation in typical political fashion. A Davis  spokesman said that the governor had expressed his anger at ""the generators  who wear cowboy hats"" and that ""just because there are other entities that  are charging us more doesn't change the fact that we are getting ripped off  by companies from Houston, Tulsa, Atlanta or Charlotte."" Yet, for all Davis' feigned indignation about consumers being ripped off, it  turns out that he and his regulators are poised to ensure that business  consumers are ripped off by state government. Davis has signed $43 billion in  ill-advised long-term purchase contracts at rates above-market-price. The  state must, therefore, ensure that enough business customers remain in the  current state-controlled distribution system to pay for high-priced state  power purchases. This is especially important to Davis since the high prices  are borne disproportionately by business. Thus, Davis' regulators are set to  eliminate ""direct access,"" which allows businesses to shop for cheaper power. Who's the real gouger? No matter how much Davis points the finger,  Californians are paying dearly for his political opportunism and bad  policies.",Gouger Gray Davis :,dasovich-j

With today's electricity demand expanding beyond the reach of available  supply, and nationwide electric deregulation efforts providing inconsistent  results, distributed power just may be the next big thing, according to Bear  Stearns analyst Robert Winters. With technology-laden, electricity-hungry companies popping up every time you  turn around, and blackouts and brownouts occurring more frequently as large  power grids are becoming less reliable, the analyst points towards  distributed energy services as a possible solution, and maybe the ""next big  investment opportunity for the coming decade."" In Winters' 250 page report,  ""Distributed Energy Services-The World's Power and Transportation Industries:  Set for a Revolution-Part 2,"" he examines technologies and companies within  the distributed energy services sector that might be able to take advantage  of the current situation. ""Thanks to major technological advances and energy deregulation, a wave of  new investment in the power industry has just begun. We believe that this  coming era in the power industry could resemble the wave of investments which  flooded into the telecommunications industry following the breakup of AT&T in  the early 1980's,"" said Winters. ""Companies and municipalities need to find ways to ensure the availability of  high quality, reliable power,"" added Winters. According to his research,  microturbines are the best positioned of the ""new"" technologies that would be  able to have an immediate impact on electric generation. He based his recommendation on the fact that microturbines are small, quiet,  efficient and very versatile. ""They can be used as a main power source, a  back-up power source or as an alternative when there is a spike in  traditional energy prices,"" the analyst said. ""Microturbines can also be used  in remote locations, including developing countries, that do not have access  to electricity."" Another attractive feature of microturbines is their fuel  requirements. The units often use natural gas, but can also use several other  fuels as well. In the study, the analyst also examined fuel cells, flywheel technology, and  existing reciprocating engines technologies such as diesel engines and  Stirling engines, which he noted are enjoying a comeback. In addition to the report, Winters initiated coverage on two distributed  energy companies. He labeled Active Power, a company that is pioneering  flywheel technology, as a ""buy"" and Capstone Turbine Corp., a leading  manufacturer of microturbines, as ""attractive.""

Nevertheless, some of the issues we face in California  include:  1. POWER PLANTS The utilities' subs are building power plants; competitors (like Enron) are  also trying to develop plants to sell power into both wholesale and retail  markets. The utilities control the interconnection of plants to the grid. The interconnection rules are currently so vague and ambiguous, that the  utility could quite easily favor its generation sub over competitors. This would have an effect on prices at both the wholesale and retail level  (i.e., how do we know we've gotten the best generation deal if the utility  can favor its subs plants via interconnection?). 2. DISTRIBUTED GENERATION And the same goes for DG:  in California many are pointing to DG as a viable  solution to the price spikes. If the utility loses sales because a customer has installed DG on her  premises as a hedge against price spikes, the utility will have an incentive  to thwart interconnection of the DG unit. (Recall that in many places,  recovery of distribution costs is derived from kwh sales; and if sales go  down, so can recovery of the utilities' distribution-related costs). In addition, if someone attempts to install DG at the grid level (as opposed  to on-site DG) and sell the DG power in wholesale and retail markets, the  utility has the ability to frustrate the DG project via interconnection. This permits the utility to retain bundled service customers. Utility  control of DG Interconnection can also permit the utility to favor its DG  subs. 3.

611,_2775.subject,"Today's hearing was dominated by : 1) many lawyers arguing over whether the Commission must declare that the  ""rate freeze"" is over before raising rates, or whether the Commission can  rely on its general constitutional and statutory authority to raise rates on  an interim basis, without addressing the issue of the rate freeze, and,  1) an appearance by Ralph Nader. The Legal Issue In general, our proposal seems to have gotten some traction. Whether it  sticks remains to be seen, however. We proposed that:  The Commission has the authority to raise rates without addressing the rate  freeze issue. The Commission will not have the facts it needs, and it won't have  provided  the due process necessary by Jan 4th, to address all the complex issues tied  to the rate freeze. And if it tries, it's likely to face a flurry of law  suits, which is in no one's best interest. For it's Jan 4th decision, the Commission should confine itself to  determining whether, and if so by how much, to raise rates to maintain the  utilities' access to capital markets. (We've taken no position on whether  there's a need to raise rates.) setting a hearing schedule to examine the ""rate freeze"" and all related  issues thoroughly and methodically. The utilities argued that the Commission must declare an end to the rate  freeze; otherwise any Commission decision to raise rates would be easy to  attack in the courts. (In reality, the utilities want the Commission to end  the rate freeze in order to assure lenders that the Commission will permit  the utilities to recover going-forward procurement costs. Under the rate  freeze, the utility is at risk for procurement costs that exceed the rate  freeze.) In his presentation, our outside counsel offered numerous citations to past  Commission decision and court cases supporting the Commission's ability to  raise rates if it found it necessary to do so. Many other parties agreed  with our position. A few parties said that the issue was too murky to make a  call. During questioning, both the President of the Commission (Loretta  Lynch) and the presiding judge seemed to indicate that they believe the  Commission has ample authority to raise rates without having to address the  rate freeze issues. The Ralph Factor Apparently, having lost the Presidential election, Ralph Nader's still  looking for work. He showed up at the hearings today and held a very lengthy  news conference. From what I could hear, he targeted all of his criticism at  the utilities for being greedy, and at the Governor for being too ready and  willing to bail the utilities out. Even when thrown some soft balls about  ""out of state generators,"" Nader stuck to bashing the Governor and the  utilities. But I couldn't hear the entire press conference, so he may have  said things that I missed. The Next Steps The hearings that were scheduled to end today will now go into next week. Tomorrow, the utilities are scheduled to make their case for financial  hardship. Customers intend to question the utilities very aggressively (as  does the PUC). The utilities will also have the chance to question the  consumer representatives who filed their own proposals and analysis with the  Commission. On Tuesday, the Commission is likely to take up the issue of how big any rate  increase needs to be and how much of the increase each customer group should  shoulder. More tomorrow on the call.

621,_2833.subject,"Late afternoon 1/3/01 news:   USA: Calif utility ratings may fall too far on 7-15 pct hike. By Jonathan Stempel  01/03/2001  Reuters English News Service  (C) Reuters Limited 2001. NEW YORK, Jan 3 (Reuters) - Bankruptcy may loom and the credit ratings of the  two largest California electric utilities will likely fall too far if that  state's Public Utilities Commission awards them an interim rate hike of 7 to  15 percent, analysts said Wednesday. In a draft decision on Wednesday, the CPUC proposed an immediate hike of 9  percent for residential customers of Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and Southern  California Edison, and hikes of seven to 15 percent for various business  customers. The CPUC commission is expected to issue a final decision on Thursday. ""It forces the utilities and their creditors to be limbo dancers, and skilled  limbo dancers at that,"" said Shawn Burke, head of U.S. investment-grade  research at Barclays Capital. PG&E and SCE had requested respective rate increases of 26 percent and 30  percent, a hike that would help them avoid imminent bankruptcy. The utilities have also asked the regulators to remove a freeze on retail  rates imposed under California's 1996 law that deregulated the state's  electricity market. On a day when most stocks roared ahead after the Federal Reserve announced  surprise interest rate cuts, investors beat down the stocks of Pacific G&E's  parent, San Francisco-based PG&E Corp. , and SoCal Edison's parent, Edison  International . PG&E shares closed Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange at $17, down  $2-9/16, or 13.1 percent, while Edison International shares closed at  $12-1/4, down $2-3/4, or 18.3 percent, on the Big Board. Bond quotations were not immediately available for the utilities' bonds,  which in recent weeks have traded like junk. Pacific G&E and SoCal Edison were banking on a big rate hike to allow them to  pass on some of their soaring wholesale power costs to consumers. The utilities, which operate under a rate freeze, have accumulated more than  $8 billion in unrecovered costs since wholesale power prices started  skyrocketing last summer amid a worsening electricity shortage in the state. They claim they are running out of money due to the price freeze, and have  billions of dollars of bills coming due in the next six weeks. Central to their concerns is whether credit rating agencies Moody's Investors  Service and Standard & Poor's will cut their medium investment grades to junk  status. ""No one knows for sure, but if we consider the average rate hike is only  about 10 percent, it will be difficult for the companies to maintain  investment-grade ratings,"" said Dorothea Matthews, a fixed-income electric  utilities analyst for Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown. The utilities have already been unable to tap short-term capital markets  because of their precarious financial state. Downgrades to junk, which the agencies have already threatened, would cement  the door shut to these markets, and cause the utilities to default on some of  their loans. Late Wednesday, PG&E Chief Executive Gordon Smith said the commission's  proposed hikes could jeopardize his utility's future loans. Even a downgrade to the lowest investment grades - ""Baa3"" for long-term debt  and ""Prime-3"" for short-term debt from Moody's, and ""BBB-minus"" and ""A3"" from  S&P - would make the going very difficult for the utilities. The reason:  short-term debt markets are often closed to companies with those ratings. ""Unless this process allows the rating agencies to keep 'A2/P2' ratings on  the short-term debt of both companies, then this process has largely been a  waste of everyone's time,"" said Burke. Still, he said, ""there is a reasonable chance, despite today's weak  recommendation, that the situation can be salvaged with mid-'triple-B'  ratings, which would allow a lifeline to conventional sources of liquidity.""

That saber-rattling cut against the grain of some rare good news in the  state's continuing electricity crisis.

713,_3897.subject,"HEADLINE: Davis faces dire political consequences if power woes linger  BYLINE: By Daniel Borenstein  BODY:  ? ?WALNUT CREEK, Calif. _ As Democrats prepare for their first statewide convention since the electricity crisis erupted, some elected officials and strategists are warning of dire political consequences if Gov. Gray Davis  fails to clean up the power mess. ?? ""All of us should be thinking about the effect the energy crisis is going to have on our chances of maintaining control of both houses, and the effect the governor will have on the ticket up and down,"" said state Sen. Don Perata, D-Alameda. ""If he has not performed well and he has a D after his name, that could be problematic."" ? ?Garry South, the governor's top political strategist, said Thursday that the state's electricity woes probably won't be over soon, but the voters  understand Davis didn't create the problem. ?? ""It won't be solved in six months,"" South said. ""This is an immediate  problem that is not susceptible to an immediate solution. This is a several-year  process to get this situation back under control."" ? ?As for the governor's critics, ""I think they should be asked to produce  their own plan. It's awful easy to take pot shots, but most of those who I read  about in the newspapers have no plan."" ? ?The intraparty sniping on the eve of the party convention highlights the frustration Democrats are feeling about the crisis_and its potential political damage. ? ?Four months ago, this weekend's convention in Anaheim seemed certain to be a Davis fete. Although Democrats had lost the presidency, Al Gore easily carried California and the party was in firm control of the Legislature and the  state's congressional delegation. ? ?Davis had led the Gore effort in California and the governor was personally and politically popular across the state. This would have been the convention for him to showcase his achievements for education, the issue he had promised  to make the hallmark of his first term. ? ?But electricity now overshadows everything else. To be sure, the governor will tout his policy achievements during a Saturday morning speech to the convention delegates. And he is not shying away from the spotlight. ? ?Tonight, he will host a party for the delegates at Disney's California Adventure Theme Park. That prompted one Democratic consultant from Sacramento who won't be attending to quip, ""We're in fantasy land here, thank you. We  don't need to go to Disneyland for that."" ? ?Some are shaking their heads in disbelief at how the governor has handled  the events of the past week. ""In many ways, he appears to have gone politically  tone deaf,"" said Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, political analyst at Claremont Graduate University. ""His instincts are not serving him well."" ? ?While his top aides were meeting with legislators last week to warn them  that a $10 billion bond package won't be enough to get the state out of the crisis, Davis was at a $10,000-per-person Palm Springs golf tournament to raise money for his re-election campaign. ? ?When his hand-picked members of the Public Utilities Commission this week approved an electricity rate hike that experts have been predicting for  months, Davis claimed that he didn't know about the plan before it was announced and that he thought it was premature. ? ?Other Democrats, however, thought the commission action was overdue. ""I'm glad to see the PUC stepping out and doing something along the lines that some of us have been talking about needing to be done for the last six or eight weeks,"" said state Sen. Tom Torlakson, D-Antioch. ""There's a high level of frustration. There haven't been clear answers to what the solution is."" ? ?South, the Davis political strategist, said a lot of factors are outside the governor's control. ""No one can predict with any certainty where this is going to go, and no one can predict when this situation is going to be brought under control. We don't control the generators, we don't control the FERC (Federal Energy Regulatory Commission), we don't control what Wall Street is going to do."" ? ?As for the potential political fallout, South said the governor and  Democrats remain in a strong position. After all, he said, the deregulation plan was pushed through by a Republican governor and Republicans in Washington are blocking efforts to cap prices. ? ?Jack Pitney, government professor at Claremont McKenna College, predicted Davis could weather the electricity crisis. ""People who are following it know it's roots run deeper than the Davis administration and the Republicans don't have any plausible alternatives,"" he said. ?? ""My read of public opinion is people don't think there's a simple and easy solution and they're not expecting one. They may be impatient but they won't necessarily take it out on (Davis)."" ? ?It's too early to predict the political outcome, said Mark Baldassare, pollster at the Public Policy Institute of California. ?? ""The impacts won't be clear until people have gone through a few billing cycles and we've gone through the summer blackouts, until we see what the personal impacts are so we know what the political impacts are,"" he said.

717,_3952.subject,"Dan Walters: Politicians seek shelter as energy Armageddon looms    (Published April 4, 2001)  There's been a subtle but unmistakable shift in the political atmosphere that  envelops California's energy crisis. Politicians have concluded that the crisis is largely beyond their control  and the die is more or less cast. Whatever fate decrees - massive summer  blackouts, soaring utility bills or even the bankruptcy of the state's  utilities - will happen, and politicians from Gov. Gray Davis downward are  scrambling to insulate themselves from voters' anger and single out rivals  for blame. No one is saying that publicly, of course, but the fatalistic mood is very  apparent in the Capitol, whose denizens have dropped their preoccupation with  energy and moved to other matters. Legislative committees are working on the  hundreds of bills that had been stalled for three months while the special  committees that had been holding almost daily sessions on the energy crisis  have gone into semihibernation. Last weekend's Democratic state convention in Anaheim was dominated by fears  that when the crisis hits home, the party's dominance of the Capitol will  backfire. ""Just remember Jimmy Carter,"" state Controller Kathleen Connell  warned fellow Democrats, adding that they will have ""no excuses"" for  perceived failure to deal with the crisis forthrightly. ""We will be  accountable on Election Day 2002,"" she said. Next year's elections are very much on Davis' mind, since he'll be seeking a  second term and polls indicate that his approval ratings have declined  sharply in recent weeks. He devoted much of the weekend to defending his  actions, saying, ""I believe we've moved at warp speed to address this  problem,"" and trying to pin blame on Republicans. Republicans, meanwhile, sense that the crisis gives them an avenue of escape  from the dungeon of irrelevancy to which they had been exiled by heavy losses  in the last three elections. The only remaining statewide GOP officeholder,  Secretary of State Bill Jones, is running for governor by accusing Davis of  mismanagement, and Republican Assembly members dumped their leader, Bill  Campbell, on grounds that he had been insufficiently aggressive vis-a-vis  Davis. The political positioning reflects the reality that the crisis shows every  sign of worsening. Although Davis' office is distributing a brochure entitled  ""Meeting the Energy Challenge"" to defend the governor's actions, it's  apparent that none of the steps the governor has taken is bearing much fruit. The state is spending at least $50 million a day on emergency power  purchases, but what was supposed to be a short-term program has evolved into  a monthslong drain on the state's rapidly shrinking budget reserves. The  long-term supply contracts that were supposed to replace daily spot purchases  have bogged down, and without firm contracts and a revenue stream to pay for  them, Wall Street is reluctant to market the bonds the state wants to float. Many authorities now believe Davis' decision to step into the power purchase  market in January was a strategic error because it gave power suppliers a  deep new pocket to tap just as the utilities themselves ran out of credit. Davis, meanwhile, is refusing to embrace a rate increase approved by the  state Public Utilities Commission, which sends a mixed message to Wall  Street, and efforts to resolve problems with unpaid bills from power  generators and have the state acquire the utilities' intercity transmission  grid have stalled, perhaps permanently. The crisis may careen totally out of control as summer arrives, raising the  specter of elderly and/or ill Californians dying from having their air  conditioners or medical equipment shut down. And the utilities are closer to  bankruptcy now than at any other point in the nearly yearlong crisis. Plan A isn't working, and there is no Plan B - except for bankruptcy. With  Armageddon looming, politicians have retreated into the bunker, hoping to  protect themselves from what could be a firestorm of anger.

By ROBERT J. LOPEZ and RICH CONNELL, Times Staff Writers   In the summer of 1999, a top official with a major player in California's  power market testified during a congressional committee hearing in support of  speeding up deregulation. Unleashing market forces, said the Dynegy Inc.  executive, would ensure ""maximum customer savings"" and ""low-cost power."" That same month, the Houston-based firm made a far different pitch to Wall  Street: Deregulation and major swings in electricity prices would boost  revenue and stock value. ""We know how to take advantage of volatility spikes  across the gas and power market,"" Chief Executive Officer Charles Watson  declared in a publication targeting large investors. ""The energy  marketplace,"" he predicted, ""will simply get more volatile."" Dynegy was not alone, a review of federal filings, company documents and  public records shows. In the years since California's pioneering deregulation  plan was approved, other major out-of-state energy suppliers were sending  similar, seemingly contradictory signals to the public and stock buyers.

730,_414.subject,"Harry:    At the meeting yesterday, we concluded that it would be a good idea to take  the proposal that you put together based on your meeting with EES and use it  as the ""base case"" to start running the numbers. Idea being that before we  shop anything around, we need to know what the numbers look like to determine  whether the thing's got any legs. Once we have a clear understanding of how the base case  numbers shake out,  we thought we might then want do some sensitivity analyses around the  variables, come up with a final proposal, and then go back to the commercial  groups for buy-in. We hoped that your folks could get together with Roger  Yang et al and provide some assessment of what the base case numbers look  like by middle of next week. How's this plan sound? Few other points:  We assume that bullet 6's reference to ""net"" means that the deferral is  calculated by taking any ""overcollections"" and subtracting them from any  ""undercollections"" over the entire 3 year period,not year-by-year. What is the significance of the 3.1 CTC roll-off date? We're assuming it's  commercially driven. We correct? If so, what's the driver? Same goes for  the 2004 ending date. Some tweeks were made to the proposal at the meeting to create an ""Option 2""  for folks to consider. (Though we don't think that any numbers need to be  run on ""Option 2"" until after having completed the analysis on option 1,  since those results could influence any scenarios we decide to construct). Option 2 would: Keep the hydro with the utility and apply Edison's proposed ratemaking  treatment. Beginning 6.1.01, make large customers ""noncore,"" similar to the gas model in  California, and force those customers to choose an ESP. Beginning 1.1.03, introduce competitive default service for remaining ""core""  (i.e., rez and small commercial) customers. ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ Finally, couple of things that occurred to me after yesterday's meeting that  I want to throw out for folks to react to:  Seems that, to be successful, the proposal needs to remain as stripped down  and simple as possible. When the proposal nets out the deferral costs, does it include the  over/undercollections associated with utility residual generation? In option 2, by adding the ""noncore"" feature, and by implementing that  feature and the default service feature prior to the 04 ending date, the  proposal gets more complicated (and adds significantly more risk to the  utility's position). This is not to say that the complications can't be  worked out, or that the added risk can't be accounted for, but wanted to  highlight it for folks to consider.

Executive Order D-34-01 Many numerous and complicated statutes, regulations, policies and procedures  are delaying deployment of the energy conservation funding outlined in SB 5X  and AB 29X signed by the Governor two weeks ago. Executive Order D-34-01 will  speed up implementation of the measures. Together, the two bills provide over $850 million for energy conservation and  distributed generation programs designed to save over 2,000 megawatts this  summer. With the Executive Order, the Energy Commission will not have to go  through the cumbersome process of guideline adoption to approve funding. The  programs in the demand reduction program that will be streamlined included: Public Agency Loans and Grants (ECAA);  Time-Of-Use and Real-Time Meters;  Municipal Program; and  Cool Roofs/Building Materials Executive Order D-33-01 Governor Davis signed Executive Order D-33-01 to extend the conservation  rebate of the ""20/20"" program to the customers in the territory serviced by  the San Diego Gas and Electric Company. The program is designed to help the  state avoid the likelihood of blackouts this summer and reward consumers who  significantly conserve energy. In addition, it could save the state up to  $1.3 billion in power costs by reducing the amount of electricity the state  must buy during expensive summer peak periods. Executive Order D-32-01 In Executive Order D-32-01, Governor Davis orders the transfer of funds from  the Energy Commission to the Department of Water Resources for implementation  of the power plant construction incentive program. Incentives will include:  $5,000 per megawatt (MW) of average electrical output on the first 100 MW and  $2,500 per MW for each MW above 100 MW, if brought on-line by July 1, 2001;  $4,000 per MW of average electrical output on the first 100 MW and $2,000 per  MW for each MW above 100 MW, if brought on-line between July 2, 2001 and  August 1, 2001; and  $3,000 per MW of average electrical output on the first 100 MW and $1,500 per  MW for each MW above 100 MW, if brought on-line between August 2, 2001 and  August 31, 2001.

McCrea pushed back initially on core/noncore (""why should it be mandatory to  go the market? ""), but after much discussion they agreed that our idea for  core/noncore has a lot of merit. Our idea is that 1) the core/noncore would take effect in 18-24 months, when  the markets settle and prices come down, 2)  everyone (core and noncore)  should pay for DWR's ""past"" purchases, since everyone consumed it, 3) core  customers should take IOU generation, QFs and DWR contracts (which eliminates  the core's ""net short"" position, and 4) noncore would go to market and would  not have to pay for any of DWR's ""going forward costs"" (since core gets them,  in exchange for getting all the low-cost IOU generation) I told them we are still crunching the numbers to see what the rate effects  would be and would share it with them when we're done. While they are supportive of this approach and agreed that it would be useful  to continue to flesh it out, they are not convinced that it will get the  necessary support to get passed.

776,_4692.subject,"Power shortage shifts attitudes  Posted at 10:51 p.m. PDT Sunday, May 20, 2001  BY NOAM LEVEY  Mercury News Sacramento Bureau  California's spiraling energy crisis, already menacing the state's economy  and sucking billions of dollars out of the state treasury, has dramatically  shaken Californians' confidence in their future and their governor, a new  poll shows. Nearly half of the state's residents now believe California is headed in the  wrong direction, a stunning reversal from just five months ago, when nearly  two-thirds believed the state was headed in the right direction, according to  the poll conducted by the Public Policy Institute of California. And bearing the brunt of this new pessimism is Gov. Gray Davis, whose  approval ratings have plummeted to 46 percent, down from 63 percent in  January, when the San Francisco-based institute conducted its last poll. ``We have seen slow deteriorations in public attitudes during tough times in  the past,'' said Mark Baldassare, who directed the survey. ``But what is most  surprising is the speed at which this change has occurred. . . . It is very  dramatic.'' Indeed, the energy crisis now dominates all other issues confronting  Californians, according to the survey of 2,001 residents statewide. Forty-three percent of respondents listed electricity as the most important  issue facing the state, compared to just 13 percent who identified growth and  6 percent who identified education as the next most important issues. In  recent years, Californians have consistently ranked education as their top  issue. And nearly two thirds of respondents said they fear the issue of supply,  demand and cost of electricity will hurt the California economy ``a great  deal.'' ``Without electricity we can't do much of anything, especially work, and  without work the economy will continue to tank,'' said Maria Griffiths, a  46-year-old juvenile court clerk in San Jose. Results dismissed  The governor's top political adviser, Garry South, dismissed the findings as  predictable. ``The voters are in a very bad mood. They are not happy with  anyone in this drama,'' South said. ``But these poll numbers need to be taken  in context. . . . People don't understand what he's done because it is very  hard to communicate that in this state.'' South emphasized that he believes Californians will understand the extent of  Davis' efforts by the time they go to the polls next year. Davis is expected  to run for re-election next year, and several Republicans, including  Secretary of State Bill Jones, are already lining up to challenge him. Davis  also has his eyes on the presidential election in 2004. The survey found that most Californians do not blame Davis for the current  electricity crisis. Only 10 percent say he and the current Legislature are  culpable, compared to 32 percent who blame the utilities and 26 percent who  blame former Gov. Pete Wilson and the legislators who passed California's  landmark deregulation five years ago. ``He didn't make the deregulation disaster. I think that's Pete Wilson's  legacy,'' said John Putica, 52, a bank loan officer in San Jose. Criticism for Davis  But there are nonetheless troubling signs for the man charged with leading  California out of its power troubles. Sixty percent of those polled said they disapprove of how Davis is handling  the power crisis, much to the delight of Republicans who have hammered the  governor for not doing more. Davis has emphasized that the solution to the state's electricity crisis  involves more power plants, more conservation and federal intervention to  control the price that California is being forced to pay for power. The state has approved 15 new power plants since Davis was elected. But for  the past several weeks, the governor has been fighting an escalating war of  words with the White House over President Bush's unwillingness to support  price caps on electricity. Bush's energy plan released last week again rejected price controls and  focused instead on rapidly boosting the nation's supply of power. The Public Policy Institute of California's survey found that 43 percent of  Californians believe that new power plants offer the best solution to the  crisis. But there is far less support for either conservation or price caps; 18  percent identified conservation as the most important solution, and just 8  percent favored federal price controls on generators. That news was warmly received by a representative of power generators, who  have been accused by Davis and others of artificially inflating the price of  power to mine the California market for excessive profits. ``I think the public is skeptical of the actual benefits of trying to cap the  price of power,'' said Jan Smutny-Jones, executive director of the  Independent Energy Producers Association. Electricity generators argue that  price caps will discourage the construction of more power plants. Backing re-regulation  Meanwhile, consumer groups, who have been advocating for re-regulation of the  electricity market, were left to hope that support for more controls will  come when Californians' power bills start rising next month. ``People don't yet understand that generators are responsible for cutting off  the juice,'' said Harvey Rosenfield of the Santa Monica-based Foundation for  Taxpayer and Consumer Rights. ``But in three weeks, California is going to  face a catastrophe. This is going to hit supernova status. . . . Once people  understand what the causes are here, I think they will understand that the  only solution will be re-regulation.'' Whether they will trust the state to come up with a solution is unclear,  however. ``The electricity problem has not only had major consequences on how people  view their leaders and their short-term future,'' said Baldassare of the  Public Policy Institute of California. ``There is less confidence in the  state's ability to plan for the long-term future. And that is giving people  worry. ``This crisis and the general economic uncertainty have severely undermined  public confidence in California's future and its leaders.''

777,_4700.subject,"Hertzberg called. We very briefly discussed the scenarios that he asked us  to build for him. I've attached the file. the supporting spreadsheets are  not included. If folks would like them, let me know. Please keep the file  confidential. Hertzberg wanted to see what happened to rates for large (noncore) customers  if the small (core) customers' share of past utility debt is shifted to  noncore customers. Our analsis shows that noncore rates approach Loretta's recent rate increases  when approximately 50% of core's share of utility past debt is shifted to  businesess (i.e., to noncore). (In fact, Edison's rate in this scenario is  below the Lynch rate, while PG&E's is modestly above.) Increasing the cost shift above the 50% level would start to push rates  significantly above the Lynch rates. Note, however, that in its recent submission to the PUC, DWR's asserts that  it's revenue requirement is substantially higher than the revenues support by  the Lynch rate increase, suggesting that Lynch will have to increase rates  again soon. In addition, Loretta's rates also do not reflect past utility costs, which  will require yet additional increases. I expect to have another conversation with the Speaker later this evening or  tomorrow to discuss the scenarios in more detail  (he would still like to put  100% of the IOUs past debts on noncore in exchange for getting a competitive  market and out from under Loretta).

Both test came back abnormal and  I am seeing a specialist this week to determine if I need to have a biopsy or not. Since God has given me the task of doing a mighty work for him the devil has been busy. I trust and believe that God will heal. God gave me a revelation several months ago that ALL IS WELL since that time, my husband and I have reunited our family, we have been blessed tremendously in more ways than I can share with you at this time, however, in the midst of those blessings, the devil has gotten mad. So he has decided to try and pull me down once again. I refuse to be brought down off this spiritual high that is truly a blessing from God. That is why I am calling on all you prayer warriors I need you to be in prayer with me this week. I see the specialist on Thursday and I will know then if I need to have the biopsy.

If so, realize your environment plays an important role in your life. Hostile  environments create defensiveness, and an individual's negative behavior can  directly affect others who are trying to maintain a healthy attitude. For example, if you are working with a supervisor who constantly berates  those under him/her in front of others, this negative behavior affects  everyone in the office. And hanging around negative friends and family  members can reinforce your own negative traits. (For example, your temper is  under control as long as you are not around your older brother.) In addition,  negative people can induce others into developing the same negative attitudes  and behaviors that they possess. It is true the company you keep is a  reflection on you and can influence your behavior.

At the risk  of being bold,  I think the undercurrent of your note and your discussions  with Haedicke over the last couple of days is a matter of absolute control. Ownership and passion are important characteristics of our best commercial  people but so is fostering a diversity of opinions and ideas. With the back  and mid office,  the current Enron model is based upon scale and  standardization which generates tremendous operating leverage. Further, it  helps us manage risk and is a board mandated control issue.

876,_1507.subject,"Wow, if Haug spent more time making money than created bull.... in the  company we would be a $100 stock. On a different note, I was wondering if someone in your shop could map the  current A&A process from planning for on-campus recruitment to manager  promotion  for the typical associate including timeline. This process  mapping should be very detailed to give us the greatest insight. I think radical change is not the answer. The answer lies in a combination  of a) slight changes in process; b) increasing participation/ownership at key  points in the process by certain business units and people; and c) a credible  key business spokesman or spokespersons co-opting the other units where  necessary and providing the commercial leadership and representation for the  program internally. Overall this is a commercial program that needs to meet  commercial objectives - the closer to the front the better. The goals of any restructuring are:  a) eliminate the perception that the program is not receptive to the  business units needs or any bu's perception that they lack ownership for the  program;  b) increase the quality of the recruits that are brought in and retained;  c) ensure we have the best people in the organization recruiting, selling  and interviewing;  d) ensure that we have the best commercial training program that firmly  grounds the associate in the ""Enron technology"" which include skills in  market understanding, structuring, finance, logistics and risk;  e) ensure the business units have the ability to identify the outstanding  talent early and give those people the responsibility necessary to move them  up the curve quickly (ie) quickly identify the Whalley/Lavorato's in the  program and, on the flip side, quickly deal with clear non-performance issues;  f) review the effectiveness of the current PRC process as a development,  retention and performance tool;  g) incorporate mid-year flexibility, internet recruiting techniques,  non-traditional sources of talent and  h) increase cost effectiveness.

The consultants name is Joe Petrowski (203)451-9747. I spoke to him  yesterday afternoon and promised that one of you would be in contact.

891,_201.subject,"Ken, I have taken a look at the material you had sent me on the ARC Northern  Gas Pipeline Route. Ultimately, I believe that ARC is looking for certain  strategic investors to provide founding capital to fund the development of  this proposal. To the extent that this is a open access non-discriminatory  pipe, ENA's opportunity lies in being a shipper to capitalize on basis  markets or customer transactions that provide attractive risk reward  characteristics. Other than understanding the potential flows and costs,  there is probably not much we need to do today given a 2006 start from an ENA  point of view. The ARC consortium needs to fund approximately $30M to develop this project. The US and Canadian aboriginal groups will receive 33% ownership for $10M. the remaining $20M and 67% will be funded by a group of producers, pipelines,  venture capital and the ""organizing group"" (40%!!). Stan Horton, if he  believes this is a commercial possibility, may want to provide a few million  of founding capital to the venture in order to preserve him the option to  participate as an equity holder or operator if this becomes a reality.

924,_335.subject,"Jeff, you will be receiving a DASH from the principal investing group which  does not fit well into some of the charter criteria; however, I do think this  is a venture we should support. In a nutshell, it is providing $10MM, in  seed capital, to be used in the start up of a new distributed generation  company having the primary mission of designing, fabricating and marketing  2MW to 22MW mobile turbine-generator sets. These units are fully mobile via  the nations highways and can meet single digit NOX requirements given current  SCR technology. They are primarily utilized for back-up power, emergency  power, VAR creation and peaker application and are fully dual fuel capable. The ultimate vision is a fleet of mobile/flexible/low cost generator sets  that can be put in place very quickly in the most stringent emissions and  constrained electrical regions and relocated when market conditions change. The benefits include:  a) 50% plus interest in a new distributed generation company with the  opportunity to raise private funds at later rounds and ultimately the  possibility of an IPO - similar companies in this space include Active Power,  Capstone and Elektryon;  b) origination opportunities - the ENA mid-stream origination groups believe  that there are numerous opportunities (2001 to 2002 time frame) to utilize  this technology to take advantage of market opportunities and customer  applications;  c) learning - the distributed generation/renewable space is an area of  critical importance for ENA and EES to understand. If ENA through this  venture can make this technology work, it could be a very powerful tool in  our network used to capture opportunity and manage risk;  d) low risk - it is expected that roughly 50% of the initial seed capital  would be recoverable through asset sales if for some reason the technology  did not work or the market did not materialize;  e) low tech - this solution utilizes existing turbine/SCR technology;  and f) ENA would have a controlling position in this new venture. However, this venture is different than Active Power and several other  Principal Investing investments in that a) it is a very early stage company  and b) ENA will have to provide or procure a complete management team if the  technology proves out. Given, that we could benefit most from the successful  application of this venture, it is worth the initial work. Our partner is Power Systems Manufacturing of Boca Raton, Florida. We have a  very solid history with this company. They have successfully solved many of  the technical issues surrounding the Korean 6B's which are currently  operating at New Albany. They would bring the technical and engineering  expertise at cost for their 50%. ENA would ultimately have a buy-out clause  at a fixed number for their 50% . If you would like to discuss in greater detail do not hesitate to call and I  will set up a meeting. Regards",Cangen,delainey-d

In addition, ENA is  paying a higher price, sharing credits and have voluntarily increased the  term to twelve years from ten. I do not understand what is holding up completing this transaction other than  a complete re-trade on the original transaction. I hope this is not the  case. The ENA team worked hard to facilitate this transaction for Enron  Wind.

I am asking for the three teams to  clearly identify the outsourcing targets, lead sales and structuring people  and the timing as far as starting discussion with each target customer  (ASAP). I would hope that the Mexican and Canadian teams would lead the  sales process and the Houston team lead the structuring, customer facing and  execution but I will let you decide the optimum mix.

However, I would caution that  real value is created through RAPID brownfield development leveraging on  Enron's development, electricity, coal and emissions talents. For ComEd and Homer City, Mission has already paid up for these assets based  on gas being on the margin. Now that was before a lot of the run up so it  may be worthwhile; however, I think it may be difficult to arb these guys.

We should probably take a shot at the smaller probably less core Virginia  assets. Are they in QF, if so there may be upside in the deal from Duran's  point of view..

It is my understanding  that the benefit of the elimination of those shorts resides in the Portland  shop. The elimination of the shorts would not have occurred without the  lawsuit on the alliance and the settlement I originated.

1040,_55.subject,"The very first time that I laid eyes on  Steve Susman , he was clad only in  his underwear. Moreover, he was  shouting  and angrily brandishing his fist  at me! The Northern Lights may have seen stranger sights, but I assure you I  have not. In 1968 or 1969 (you will understand that I have repressed the actual date),  I journeyed to Fort Worth, Texas as a representative of the Texas Law Review  to attend some State Bar of Texas committee meeting, one being held, I think,  in conjunction with an annual meeting of the Bar. The Law Review had  reserved a few rooms at one of the downtown hotels. I arrived late at  night,  dutifully registered at the hotel's desk, received my room  key,   took the elevator to the designated floor, walked to my room, inserted the  room key, and opened the door. The darkness that shrouded the room was  suddenly pierced by a flare of light that revealed to my astonished eyes a  bear of a man, almost naked, leaping out of the bed toward me, shaking a very  large fist in the vicinity of my face, and demanding to know why I had  violated the sanctity of his room! It will surprise none who know Steve to learn that although he was   adamantly insisting  on an explanation, he refused to be quiet long enough  for me to offer him one. Knowing even at my then tender young age a madman  when I see one, I exited  the scene of the controversy with as much speed as  my terrified legs could muster and rushed back to the front desk with my tale  of adventure and close escape from severe bodily injury. There may well have  been some talk of calling hotel security or the Fort Worth Police, but in the  end I settled for a new room, the door of which I bolted immediately. After a mostly sleepless night during which I anticipated the imminent  reappearance of the madman, I arose, showered,  dressed, and carefully made  my way to the meeting room. During the course of the day, I spotted the  madman across the ballroom engaged in conversation with another individual. Surreptitiously pointing him out to one of my friends, I asked if he knew  him. The answer was no, but he did know who he was. ""The name is Susman, my  man, Steve Susman"". I immediately resolved that my path and that of   ""Susman, my man, Steve Susman"" would never again cross. Truth is indeed stranger than fiction. How could I have possibly foreseen  as I fled from the madman in  that Forth Worth hotel room so many years ago  that not only would my path again cross his but that I would one day serve as  his lawyer, that  he  would serve as mine,  and that I would count him  as  one of my closest friends! I hereby officially  forgive you, Steve, not only  for stealing my  Fort Worth hotel room but also  for the injury you wished on  me that night. Looking back on it, I wouldn't want it to have been  any  other way. I wish you the Happiest of Birthdays, Steve. Thanks for your friendship--I",Steve Susman,derrick-j

The protections  and remedies afforded by the Master track those  that Enron would have under a loan document. Enron would be in no better  position to collect from NUI in the event of bankruptcy under a loan document  than under the Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement.

1154,_402.subject,"In February, 539,594 Mmbtu were allocated to the our index purchase from HPLR  Liquids at King Ranch. This allocation resulted in a large physical  unaccounted for loss. Effectively, the gas was being purchased twice in our  systems. In addition, a sale to the Liquids group, which should have been  zero, was brokered with a purchase from Swift (2500 Mmbtu/day), resluting in  additional gas being allocated to the HPLR Liquids purchase contract. I have  attached a schedule detailing the volumes that were double booked in  February. This schedule also reports the daily volumes for March which will  need to be adjusted. I have calculated (based on estimates) that we should  have only purchased about 88,000 from the Liquids group at King Ranch for  February.

We can increase this to 3,000/day for March. The majority of gas in the 3-Rivers system is transported to the King Ranch  plant through HGPL. Some of this gas is purchased at the wellhead by HPLC,  some of the gas is purchased at the wellhead by HPLR Liquids, and three  producers have the option to either sell their gas to HPLC at the wellhead or  to process their gas and sell the residue to HPLC at the tailgate of the  plant. It is very important to keep the meters and volumes allocated  correctly among parties related to these transactions. The attached schedule  should assist in doing this. I have reported the meters at which HPLC buys  wellhead gas. The movement of this gas through HGPL and King Ranch should be  kept seperate from the gas purchased by the Liquids group.

It was built in 86, so it needs a  little work. But that's ok with me. Anyway, we are closing on both houses  on Monday and moving Tuesday and Wednesday.

The database  is sorted by that information with a +/- 2 degrees on the temps, and provides  an average volume for that criteria. (For example:  With temps of 40-60, the  sort would produce a list of the volumes pulled for each day with a low of 38  to 42 degrees and a temperature spread of 20 to 22 degrees. An average is  then calculated from that volumetric data. In this case, the average is  calculated to 259,000 Mmbtu.)

Things to consider:  if weather is cloudy or sunny, wet or dry;  wind chill;   Entex's obligation on Midcon;  Entex's recent operating procedures;  Entex  takes versus our prior estimates (have we been under or overestimating  volumes each day), etc. Additionally, since we only see about 30% of the meters, we apply a factor to  estimate the remaining 70%.

1193,_101.subject,"Per Louie Soldano, I called Dave Sinclair (GPG ROW) about whether we have any  ability to negotiate a favorable right of way deal with the BNSF railroad. In Dave's experience, that is a nonstarter. Apparently, a bunch of  utilities, including us through Dave, have even formed a coalition to try to  figure out how to get the railroads to be more cooperative. If the RR owns  its ROW outright (which many of the old railroads do out west) we might be  able to condemn an easement by getting a FERC certificate. In other words,  the RR would be treated just like any other landowner. If we did that, Dave  thinks BNSF would treat it as a declaration of war. Since our lines cross or  parallel BNSF right of way all over the place from Topock to Duluth, that  would be foolish. I swore Sinclair to secrecy and told him what part of the world I was  interested in and he thought we could probably stitch together private ROW  without too much pain. If the RR option doesn't pan out, we may want to  suggest to Tino and Dennis that our ROW people can handle this. Assuming we  can't come up with some magic contact with the RR, I propose that, at the  appropriate time,  we tell Dennis and Tino that the last 7 or 8 miles of ROW  should be flagged as a potential problem that Enron can help resolve once we  decide to go forward.

1203,_1116.subject,"There were several questions left for legal/regulatory to work on at the  close of our meeting today. I'll try to restate them, and add my initial  thoughts, so we can all be sure to focus on the correct problems. Q 1. Can TW use ""negotiated rate"" agreements for its new 150 mm/d expansion? A. Yes. Independence, Guardian, and other new pipeline projects were  certificated on the basis of negotiated rate contracts. The only restriction  is that we need to always offer cost-based recourse rate service as an  alternative to negotiated rates. We hope to use negotiated rate agreements  for the entire 150 mm of capacity, but we won't know until the contracts are  executed how much of it will be negotiated rate contracts and how much of it  will be under recourse rate contracts. I guess that means that in the cert. app., we just tell the commission that we will be 100% at risk and that given  the huge interest in the open season, we have no doubts about our ability to  sell the full 150. We should also tell the Commission we expect to sell the  capacity using negotiated rate contracts or recourse rate contracts or a  combination of both. Q 2. Can we give prospective customers a ""cafeteria style"" menu of options  (to steal Jeff's term), like the following:  1. 5 yr. neg. rate deal at a locked in $.60 plus fuel and surcharges (or  whatever number we decide on)  2. 10 y. neg. rate deal at a locked in $.45 plus fuel and surcharges  3. 15 yr. neg rate deal at a locked in $.35 blah blah  4 . 15 yr cost based recourse rate plus fuel and surcharges (importantly  this option is not locked in and will float with TW's actual rate levels and  fuel retainage percentages)  A.  I think the answer here is ""yes."" Whatever options we come up with for  1, 2, and 3, we will always have to offer 4 as well. Susan and Steve  Stojic:  please confirm that we have the right to define specific negotiated  rate options and stick to them. Otherwise, this negotiated rate approach  could get completely unstructured such that we end up with some guys taking  our specific options and other guys custom tailoring weird variations (like a  7 yr, 231 day contract at $.51764, for example). I'm not sure that would be  a bad thing, but we need to think about it. We need to be sure we can tell a  customer ""no"" and make it stick if he tries to mix and match by asking for  the 5 yr term and the $.35 rate, for example. I think we can lay out options  of our choosing and then enforce a ""no substitutions"" policy (this is  sticking with the ""cafeteria"" theme) but we need to be sure. Q.3. If we can use the ""cafeteria options"" approach, how much flexibility do  we have in structuring the options? A:  This one is hard. We need to be sure that the price and term we choose  to offer for options 1-3 is solely within our discretion. We don't want to  be second guessed by FERC as to whether we should have offered option 1 at  $.58 instead of $.60. Susan and Steve: if you guys confirm that we have  discretion in how to structure our negotiated rate options, does that mean we  can slant the economics of the negotiated rate options so they are a better  deal than the recourse option (for most shippers)?

1205,_1126.subject,"Either I didn't fully understand the December Texas Eastern order or else  FERC has just put a new and unhelpful spin on it. The Thursday rehearing  order dramatically changes how the ""shipper must have title"" rule applies to  acquisitions of upstream capacity. I thought the Dec. order pretty clearly  allowed a pipe to acquire upstream capacity and then resell that capacity  under the acquiring pipeline's rate schedules. FERC specifically held that   the ""shipper must have title"" policy won't be applied if the acquiring pipe  treats the acquired capacity ""as though it were part of its own system"". (p.  61,886)  The Dec. order even cited TW's acquisition of park n ride capacity  from PG&E as an example of the type of transaction that (I thought) could be  done without advance Commission approval. Now, FERC explains that it did  not intend a ""blanket waiver"" of the shipper must have title policy. Pipes  can still acquire upstream capacity without advance FERC permission, but only  if the acquiring pipe is going to use the acquired capacity for operational  needs or to resell under the selling pipe's release mechanism. If the  acquiring pipe wants to use the acquired capacity to support sales of service  under the acquiring pipe's rate schedules, a specific waiver of the ""must  have title"" policy is required (see FN 20 and text). We are right back to  where we started. I guess the orders signal that FERC is  much more likely  to grant waivers of the ""must have title"" policy than in the past, but I  don't think we are good to go to acquire upstream storage, for example, and  resell it as FDD or IDD until we get permission first.

1209,_1185.subject,"A couple of additional thoughts on this morning's conversation:    1.  if we really think the next 6 or 8 months will sort out the takeaway and  receipt point capacity issues, why not bet the whole farm and try to hold  onto the whole 150 mm/d until next winter or fall and see if the perceived  value goes up? We could tell Calpine ""no"" on their bid and hold them off for  several months ""negotiating"" if that's what we thought would lead to the best  value. I don't personally think this would be a prudent approach, but its  where our logic leads in the extreme, so we'd better be prepared to explain  why getting the bird in the hand from Calpine is smart. 2. We'll research the question of whether we can reject any recourse bids  that come in over the next 6-8 months if we decide to hold onto the 60 mm/d  for awhile. I've thought about it a bit more and I'm pretty sure you're not  going to like the answer. First, FERC says we've got to have a recourse rate  in place for all capacity, new or old. One reason is that there needs to be  a max rate that applies to long term capacity releases. We have the option  on new projects to go with the existing max tariff rate or a new  incrementally designed rate. We are going with the existing tariff rate on  RedRock. Fine, but that makes the existing rate the recourse rate for all  purposes. FERC's logic will be that TW could sell all of the RedRock  capacity at recourse rates (currently $.38) and never suffer a revenue  shortfall even if future rate cases reduce TW's overall rates, because the  costs of all TW's facilities--including the new project--will be considered",RedRock,fossum-d

The Isleta is interested in granting Dennis ROW/lease for the power plant  as well as the pipeline. The power plant could be located on Isleta land  adjacent to the South boundary of the Scandia reservation. Thus, the power  plant could be connected to DOE's existing powerline infrastructure without  ever leaving the Isleta and DOE land. PNM would not be necessary to move  power to DOE. Unclear to me whether this approach would give the power plant  optimal access to the power grid for sales of surplus power.

My recollection is that Jim does have a good relationship  with Richardson, so this seems very likely to be effective.

1258,_304.subject,"Another Tino-gram. DOE disclosed to Team Tino that they pay a $7.06/mo  demand charge per KW in addition to the $.053/kwh energy charge. Tino didn't  know whether that was per KW of monthly demand, per KW of non-coincident peak  usage, or what. The PNM tariff for govt. service is priced at $7.16/KW of  ""demand above 10,000kw during peak period""  (peak period is daytime) so I  assume that is how it is calculated. If that is the tariff (""Schedule  4000B"") under which DOE really takes service, this is interesting because  that is not a very big discount off of the stated rate. It is also  interesting that DOE is paying $.053/kwh for energy since the Schedule 4000B  energy rate is $.05072/kwh (maybe the difference is surcharges or something). Tino's consultant has figured out that the demand charge equates to an  incremental $.011 in addition to the $.053/kwh energy charge, for a total  delivered PNM rate to DOE of $.064/kwh. This is not as good as the 7 cent  number Tino threw around earlier in the week, but its still not terrible. If  the bogey is a 10% reduction to the current rate, our number to beat is  $.0576/kwh. Tino promised us copies of DOE's actual energy bills to confirm  these numbers. That would be great and solves the due diligence problem you  and I talked about yesterday, Kevin. Tino also passed along a rumor he heard from the Isleta's consultant that the  Cobisa Belen project is dead. Do we know anything about this??? Interesting.

1259,_307.subject,"I saw in the press that N.M. has delayed electric open access until Jan 1, 02  for residentials and small commercials and to July 1, 02 for large  industrials. That increases the likelihood that the Pueblo project will have  to dump power in the wholesale market at 4 Corners for a while before retail  markets start to open up. One more thing to factor in. I'm expecting to hook up with Bill Votaw of Enron Federal Solutions today to  talk about Langley's ""sole source"" procurement strategy with DOE. I hope to  get Votaw on the phone with Langley's D.C. govt. contracts lawyers to discuss  their theory. We should be in a better position to raise a flag if the sole  source strategy is really a high risk approach. I'm not sure where that  would leave us because the only other approach I can think of is to steer DOE  into opening the power plant up for bids. Langley does not appear interested  in trying to win an open bid for the power plant, although frankly we would  probably have about as good a chance as anyone of winning. Once we clear up the government contracts issues (if ever) it seems to me  that it would be time to expand the team to include Federal Solutions  (potentially, if they see an angle to help them with their Kirtland  outsourcing strategy) and ENA. The ENA involvement would be particularly  important so we could get a line of specific turbine availability and the  specifications/economics that would result. I'm probably engaging in wishful  thinking again, but my hope is that the economics on a specific turbine/heat  exchanger configuration work out a little better than the generic economics  from the model that James ran. If we think this thing is a potentially  viable deal after I talk to Votaw and the Langley DC team, we need to grab  Bill Cordes and discuss whether we go to ENA ""from the bottom up,"" or through  Stan ""from the top down"" to get hooked into a deal team over there.

1264,_352.subject,"I reviewed the latest draft of AA's management rep. letter and caught a few   innaccuracies in the way AA described the deal. I attach a revised draft of  the letter, with a redline version to highlight for you the changes I think  we need to make to keep it accurate. First, AA only listed two of the four  agreements that comprise the deal. They apparently forgot that we had  created a second SBA. Additionally, at Transcanada's request, we put the  transaction fee into a separate letter agreement this year. You will recall  that last year, Sempra wanted the transaction fee put right in the SBA. Second, AA's bullet no. 4, as originally drafted, states that Northern does  not intend to enter into an option to purchase any base gas during the term  of the agreement. That statement is confusing given that Article VI.B of the  Monthly Pack Agreement includes an account balance cash out mechanism that is  a form of purchase option. That cash out mechanism was in Kent's bullets  describing the deal and has been in every draft of the documents that AA  looked at, so I assume they are OK with the mechanism and were just inartful  in drafting bullet no. 4. My simple fix was to leave AA's language alone  but to add an ""except for"" reference at the beginning of bullet no. 4. Third, AA's draft of bullet nos. 5 and 6 includes the somewhat ambiguous  references to ""other agreements"" and ""additional agreements"" respectively. Since AA's list of the agreements in the intro paragraph was incomplete,  these references in bullet nos. 5 and 6 were also innacurate. Now that I  have made the list of agreements in the intro paragraph complete, I've  clarified the bullets by adding the ""other than those agreements referenced  above"" language to both bullets. The couple of other changes in bullet 5  simply clarify the meaning. Finally, I've modified the signature blocks per conversation with Bill to  delete MKM and myself. I am certainly willing and able to sign this letter,  but MKM is not up to speed on the deal and has not reviewed the agreements. Getting her up to speed enough to sign the letter would take some time. Additionally, Bill's thought was that MKM and I are his direct reports  anyway, so it doesn't serve much purpose to have the subordinates sign if the  top guy has signed.

1269,_388.subject,"Just got an update on the project that won't go away. Dennis has a meeting  lined up with DOE decisionmakers on the 25th. He is going to pitch the  project as an approximately 100 mw power plant, to be owned by (read  ""financed by"") DOE, with the gas pipeline owned by Dennis and\or third  parties (read ""Enron""?). Dennis has run economics that show the DOE will get  a more than 10% cost savings on the project compared to current PNM rates,  even assuming a fairly high gas transport cost because of the smaller gas  load. How did he do it? Very easy:  they ran the power plant economics  using about a $2.00 gas cost instead of current, real world prices. Dennis'  argument is going to be:  ""I'll take the risk on building the pipeline and  the power plant at a capped cost, and then sell the power plant to you."" ""You take the risk on gas cost:  if gas cost tracks the 18-24 month average,  you will realize your 10% cost savings, but if current fuel costs continue or  escalate, you lose."" Either way, your reliability improves and you kick  PNM in the shins."" Dennis and Tino apparently think they can sell DOE on  this. By the way, their current story on Richardson is that he won't resign,  and won't be forced out by the administration because that would create even  more publicity. You'll love this:  they think Richardson is even more likely  to sign off on the deal now because his chances of being nominated for VP or  cabinet are dead and he now has nothing to lose in DC. They think his real  angle is now to bring home the bacon to New Mexico and then run for governor  out there!!

1340,_62.subject,"Here is what we have concluded based on discussions this morning:  1) We believe that Furnas has agreed to contract and pay for 300 MW on oil to  meet regulatory requirements concerning required capacity and reserve  margin. We do not believe that they intend for us to be dispatrched above  220 MW. (Do we have any document which could substantiate this?) 2) Although  dispatch on a merit order basis would suggest that EPE runs full  time (with 300 MW available),  there are practical constraints in the  transmission system which will prohibit this from actually occuring. [ Please  describe these constraints using some official sounding jargon but minimal  detail and in particular indicate what is involved to de-bottleneck and how  long this will take. I presume that Furnas is solely responsible for the  corrective measures.] 3) Based on our analysis, the optimal operating approach would be to generate  220MW with  one turbine and 91 MW with the other for a total of 311 if  dipatched above 220 MW. If we can prove that 1) & 2) are correct or convince the lenders that they  are, then I think we can suggest that fuel oil exposure is negligibe if gas  is ready by April 01. We will have to see how it looks when we add the Sue  Garvin flex months. Therefore, a merit order analysis is only necessary if i) our supposition  about Furnas' motivations are incorrect and/or ii) the transmission problem  is cleared. If this happens it would be nice to be able to predict reduced  fuel utilization due to a) reduced dispatch during daily off-peak hours or  seasonal impacts, b) due to scheduled outages, and c) due to managing our  availabilty in such a way as to reduce fuel consumption operating losses.

1344,_97.subject,"Jose, I think the supplemental info you have provided is outstanding and  helpful to the lenders in understanding the overall picture and the history. However, its focus is not the central concern of the lenders at this point as  I understand it. The lenders and their counsel are concerned specifically  about third party liability meaning, I believe, lawsuits or claims from  parties who did not receive power because Cuiaba failed to generate. Therefore, I think the questions which Tozzinni needs to address are along  the lines of:  1) If EPE is required to sign the agreements by ANEEl, What is the extent of  damages that could be claimed in the context of such agreements? 2) Could any consequential damages be assessed? 3) Could EPE excuse itself from the legal proceedings on the basis of the bid  documents, the PPA or other agreements with Furnas, Electronote or Eletrabras? 4) How would the economic equilibrium process work in the case of a judgement  which was payable by EPE? Could the process be expedited to avert a  liquidity crisis? 5) Could EPE be denied access to the grid as a result of failure to cover a  spot market price assessed by the MAE stemming from an unscheduled outage? 6) Similarly, could EPE incur penalties or be denied transmission if they  failed to contribute in accordance with the shared liability provisions of  the agreements? 7) Will we need to sign the agreements for other reasons (such as access to  back-up power) which would be excluded from the protections by Furnas under  the PPA? 9) Could Furnas deny or delay reimbursement if the amount is not recoverable  by them or while they are awaiting word on a claims recoverability? 10) A question for insurance - Does our Business Interuption insurance  protect us in any of these instances?

For this second offering, the process we will use is as follows:  For a  period of 30 days, beginning 12:00 Noon on May 24, 2000, the Gathering and  Production Division of Dominion Transmission will accept applications for  compression rights into its gathering system for gas feeding its SCHUTTE  compressor station. The Dominion ""bubbles"" affected are 4404 & 4405. Dominion recognizes that, although limited, there does exist the incremental  capacity for throughput through these compressor stations. The incremental  capacity authorized through new compression agreements will not exceed the  limit Dominion determines to be the capacity of the existing compressors. Dominion will attempt to be flexible in approving the applications it  receives, but will limit approved applications so as to not unreasonably  interfere with the production from the existing non-compressed gas entering  the system. Please submit your written application to Joe Thompson at the  Dominion Gathering & Production Office. The application must indicate the  amount of ""incremental"" gas for the specific compression agreement. Dominion recognizes that the installation of compression requires differing  time frames. We will balance that consideration with our need to insure  that the application process is not abused to the disadvantage of other  producers; therefore, once granted, the applicant must have the compression  in place and operable within six months of Dominion's approval, or the rights  to all unconstructed capacity will be forfeited. In the event that more  requests for compression rights for incremental gas are received than for  which there is capacity, Dominion will award the rights on a prorated basis. Please include in your written request the mid number or a map of the  proposed  location where you will be requesting to install compression. Also include  the incremental volume you are wishing to transport under the compression  agreement. Your name, company name and address, state of incorporation,  phone and fax number, as well as an e-mail address, if available, should  be included (please print or type). Forward this information to:        Joseph A. Thompson     Manager, Business Development     Dominion Transmission Gathering & Production Division     500 Davisson Run Road     Clarksburg, WV  26301  After all requests are received, we will review the request and make a  determination on granting compression based on capacity available and the  capacity requests. You will be contacted as soon as possible after  June 23, 2000 to notify you of those requests that have been approved. Please realize that this is a ""window"" and the opportunity will close  after Noon on June 23, 2000. I hope that this will provide opportunity for you to increase the value  of your production facilities, and I look forward to working with you on  this opportunity to add compression. You can contact Joe Thompson at  (304) 623-8709 or Dan Stuart at (304) 623-8705 with any questions you may  have regarding this compression  ""open season"" request on Dominion Gathering.

She does not specifically know about  the deal, but does know she gave between $1M and $2M to the West desk out of  a reserve behind the scenes. I don't know for sure, but this has to be how  the $ got in the West P&L. It is booked on 11/12/99 which is between  EC3952.P (the annuity getting the unamortized $27M into the West desk) and  EC3952.S (the annuity getting the $5M from Corp into the West desk). I  hadn't paid attention until just now, but Suzette Emmons booked the deal. She ran the transport book at that time. The physical buys from Canada (EC2208.11, EC3952.15, and EC3952.11) are  booked correctly in Sitara. EC3952.11 was changed by Kathy Reeves from  ending in '08 to ending in '01 on 4/4/00.

I was at the game and it was as if the  Texas coaches got a bunch of guys from the frat houses this week and put  together a game plan on Saturday morning before kickoff. They were out of  position, slow, unmotivated, and flat out not prepared to play. I like Brown  and actually think he is a good fit, but at some point you actually have to  coach. I lay this all at his feet. Obviously the coordinators bear some  major responsibility as well. I really don't know what to expect for the  remainder of the season. They obviously are not as bad as they showed on  Saturday. But the fact remains that they are capable of playing that poorly  on any Saturday, and I really did not think that with this defense they could  be humiliated. I was very wrong. Something has to change. The fact is they  are 3-5 in the last 8 games. And were favored in all but one. Lack of  talent is no longer an excuse. I think the entire remainder of the season  hinges on this Saturday. If they play as poorly as they have all season  (they have beaten 3 terrible teams, and lost to a bad one) against Colorado,  they will lose and I could see them finishing at 6-5 and even 5-6 not out of  the question.

You guys are doing an excellent job  and we understand that you are under quite a bit of pressure with limited  staff. Our contracts state that we must notify every customer of  pipeline  allocations 12 hours in advance. We all know that this can be almost  impossible on EPNG, but because of the current price levels at Socal and the  basins, Enron needs to call each customer and notify them of their cuts with  an explanation of the pipeline cuts each day to avoid any potential  penalties. We also need to document when the call was made. In regards to  the ATM nominations on Socal (ones that we can't monitor), Enron will be  requesting full pipeline summaries of the nominations from our  counterparties. Please try to think of any nomination gaming that may take  place at these historical levels. We need to remember that our  counterparties may not act as they have in the past due to the market price  implications on their P&L. We should not rely on prior business conduct in  regards to ""standard epng allocations"" when dealing with our customers.

1785,_205.subject,"Dear Tom,   Enron would be interested in getting together with other trading partners to  discuss listing other index points at the Socal border. I think the market  requires other postings to reflect the fundamental changes in the market with  respect to transportation constraints. The market has clearly seen a  divergence in the summer spreads between PG&E and Socal interconnects. The  marginal generation load in SP-15 and Southern California this summer has  proven that Socal Gas is short delivered gas and is incapable of meeting  daily demand with flowing supplies, and will be incapable of injecting gas  during these months. Because of this, supply being transported from the  Southwest supply basins can only find a home going into PG&E. This places  downward pressure on PG&E Topock gas and upward pressure on Socal Topock  gas. Remember, Socal is an island, not because of the delivered capacity to  the border via EPNG and TW, but because of the limited capacity of Socal's  interconnects. Demand exceeds the supply interconnect capacity. There is also a divergence between Ehrenberg and Topock because of  liquidity. Topock is a more liquid market because of the upstream transport  contracts on EPNG and downstream buying patterns of certain Socal markets. The market is more diversified at Topock than Ehrenberg. The overwhelming  demand pressure on Socal gets exposed at Topock. Although Ehrenberg is the  marginal point for gas into Socal, there is more of an imbalance in upstream  capacity (EPNG and TW) to downstream capacity (Socal Topock 545,000/d) at  Socal Topock than at Ehrenberg. The Socal Ehrenberg interconnect has 1.1 bcf  of capacity and is primarily sourced by one market transporter. Ehrenberg  simply gets placed at ""market prices"" because of varying objectives. One  transporter may place gas to larger buyers to ensure flows, while smaller  buyers on Socal may not approach this transporter for supplies. This  illiquidity has led to a spread existing between Topock and Ehrenberg. Picture  the market, San Juan gas is trading well below the Permian and Waha  basins, which happen to be the marginal supply points for the west. Because  of the of the limited capacity going into Socal Topock, every transporter on  EPNG and TW wants to fill their contracts with San Juan gas first. These  molecules compete for Buyers at a limited delivery interconnect. Likewise,  all Buyers reach out for supply coming through a limited delivery  interconnect (Topock). The San Juan then trys to find an outlet going east on  the SJ east leg of EPNG. This transport leg simply displaces Permian gas  going into Plains North and allows Permian gas to head west to Ehrenberg on  the EPNG south mainline. While the Socal market peaks in the summer, so does  the EOC demand. Permian west (Keystone West meter)  cannot satisfy both the  EOC demand and the Socal demand. So for the first time ever, we saw EPNG  Waha West at maximum capacity to source transport contracts on the EPNG south  mainline. This tells the entire story. When demand exceeds all available  historical supply points, and begins to reach to Waha to meet Ehrenberg  demand, you have a paradigm shift. This eliminates any correlation that may  have existed between the supply basins and the market area. When Keystone  West reaches maximum capacity, the rule of market spreads not exceeding the  max rate transport rate then dies a fast death. There is simply no available  capacity at the Keystone West meter to allow a shipper to buy max rate  transport on EPNG and ship it to Socal. If you asked the market what the  maximum interconnect capacity at Keystone West is, 9 out of 10 would not  know. This leads to blaming market participants for wide spreads that are  above historical levels. It is like Al Gore blaming ""big oil companies"" for  the high prices of gas, when all refineries are at maximum capacity. There  simply isn't the capacity to meet demand. The supply exists, but there isn't  enough refining capacity available to meet demand. Fundamentals rule the  market in all cases. I would like to propose the following index points for the Southern  California border. The market would  be better served with supply being  included in these index points. One, Socal CA production/Socal storage/EPNG  Ehrenberg, Two, Topock TW and EPNG, Three, KRS/Wheeler Ridge. The market  will be experiencing more changes with respect to the Socal restructuring in  the future. We will then address the different interconnects and propose an  index for the Socal citygate as well. Call me on Monday to discuss the Enron Online download. Sincerely,",SOCAL,grigsby-m

Have Oman LNG and ADgas taken the risk of non-performance by DPC and  indirectly MSEB without any credit support? The only security is the equity  in DPC? Are such contracts typically secured or done with a buyer with deep  pockets? How much value was put into DPC by the shareholders? 2. Are there local public policy issues that could be addressed by local  courts with respect to the LNG contracts? Fraud? Bribery? Are there any  local law issues with respect to performance or interpretation of the  contracts? Isn't take-or-pay meaningless without credit support? 3. What are the arguments for DPC to terminate the contracts? Only where  the PPA is terminated? Payments? 4.    Who negotiated the contracts? Were there requests for credit support? From Enron? Did Enron ever promise to indirectly ""backstop"" the contracts by  its investment in Dabhol? 5. What was the discussion regarding the ""reduction in operational  capability"" language in the contracts? What was the language meant to  cover? Do we need our counterparty's approval to investigate other markets? 6. Is there any argument that DPC has already breached the contracts? Could our counterparties issue a press release claiming damages over the  entire term of the contract? Confidentiality and press releases? 7. What is the law on piercing the corporate veil for an Indian company  like DPC? Could this issue be considered separate from the contract and be  litigated in India or Oman and thus outside the arbitration? 8. What is the list of all documents that could impact on whether or not  Enron has any exposure under the LNG contracts? 9. Are there instances where the Dabhol project could fail and the LNG  contracts would not novate to MSEB? Why does it matter if the LNG contract  obligations novate to MSEB if DPC has no money? 10. Other potential claims against Enron if the LNG contracts are  terminated or not performed?",LNG Contract Questions,haedicke-m

Do monkey faces and tricks? Ten years will do, and the other 10 years I'll give you back."" So God agreed. On the fourth day, God created man and said to him, ""Your job is to sleep,  eat, and play. You will enjoy very much in your life. All you need to do is  to enjoy and do nothing. This kind of life, I'll give you a 20 year life  span."" The man objected. ""What? Such a good life! Eat, play, sleep, do nothing? Enjoy the best and you expect me to live only for 20 years? No way,  man!....Why don't we make a deal? Since the cow gave you back 30 years, and  the dog gave you back 10 years and the monkey gave you back 10 years, I will  take them from you! That makes my life span 70 years, right?"" So God agreed.

1980,_32.subject,"Richard Sanders and I talked with Elizabeth (an attorney with AEP). She was  not sure that their was a question that needed to be answered. Richard  opined that the question may have related to the effect on HPL if it lost the  Taub lawsuit. This suit relates to an alleged violation of the surface  rights agreement (Collateral Agreement) which was entered into with certain  surface owners after the Unit Agreement was signed. Richard explained that  if HPL lost the suit, it would lose its rights to maintain a pipeline and  well facilities on the property subject to the lawsuit. In that event HPL  would have to either locate its pipeline around the property or  use its  condemnation rights to acquire an easement across the property. Because the  Collateral Agreement relates to surface rights, losing those rights would not  affect HPL's rights under the Unit Agreement and thus the Taubs would not  have the right to drill a well to produce the gas that HPL has in storage.",Taub lawsuit Project Triple Lux,hyvl-d

1985,_348.subject,"Texas City Facility -  The relationship between HPL and Calpine has become and continues to be  strained. Calpine purchased the Texas City Cogeneration Facility from Enron  and Dominion Resources in early 1998. Prior to that time ENA supplied 45,000  MMBtu of gas under a fixed price contract and a Market Price agreement was in  place to provide any additional volumes that might be needed in addition to  that which Union Carbide Corporation had the contractual right to supply  under the historic arrangement, since they were the steam host for the  facility. After Calpine took over, these contracts either expired or were  terminated. At this point HPL became the sole supplier to the facility  although the interconnection with the Union Carbide delivery point with the  Calpine facility remained active and a new Transaction Agreement was put in  place whereby Calpine agreed to certain minimum and maximum quantity  obligations and agreed on the prices that would be paid for any short fall in  volumes. Since then, measurement disputes have been alleged and Calpine has  shortpaid HPL's invoices even after verbally agreeing that the amounts  invoiced were correct. Additionally, as a result of Calpine's power  purchaser's last minute notification to Calpine of reductions in the purchase  of power for the next day, which notification is usually after Calpine's next  day notification deadline to HPL, Calpine has resorted to the use of   creative force majeure situations in an effort to reduce their costs. These  notifications have occurred some thirteen (I think) times and Calpine has  provided little explanation to HPL of the nature of these events of force  majeure. When pressed for a more detailed explanation, they merely state  that they had to take down various unit(s) to repair or replace leaking  valves, etc. Clear Lake Facility -  The relationship between Calpine and HPL is not as strained with regard to  deliveries at this facility. This may be because the contract covering the  base volume of gas being delivered by HPL has not changed since it was  negotiated by ENA in 1995. Midcon remains connected to the facility and  delivers certain quantities of market priced gas. Market priced gas is  required by the facility when its requirements exceed the base volumes  supplied under the 1995 agreement. Should the power purchase agreement be  amended to allow Calpine not to deliver powered or should the power purchaser  cancel the power purchase agreement, Calpine has negotiated an amendment  allowing for the delivery of the base volumes at alternative delivery  points. Currently, HPL has advised Calpine of an upcoming event of force  majeure which will require a cessation of deliveries of gas to the facility  which certain regulatory mandated tests are being performed on the A-S  pipeline. It is not known whether the Midcon delivery point has the capacity  to handle the entire facility gas requirements or not.",Calpine Cogeneration Facility(s) relations,hyvl-d

This databse is the central master  database where we keep records of the financial agreements in either draft  form or that have been executed. London currently updates this database to  manage  its (and Singapore's) financial contracts and I would like to get the  Australian agreements plugged into the system. This database serves a number of purposes. First, it is our core memory of  contract negotiations. Anyone in Legal and Credit around the world can take  a look at this database and determine who we have entered into contract with  and what negotiation issues may be at issue. It is critical as we become a  global trading company that we are consistent in the legal positions we take  on these financial contracts. For instance, it would be quite problematic if  someone in Houston was negotiating a contract with an ISDA counterparty and  asserted that a certain position was critical, if we find out a lawyer in  another office was negotiating with the same counterparty and gave on the  same position the day before. We need to make a somewhat coordinated effort  on the counterparty front. In addition, with so many masters and so many counterparties there is just no  way to keep track of what we have said or done unless we have a database. Further, we use the information in the database to respond to inside  auditing, reporting and insurance inquiries. For online trading, I check the database to see if we have a financial master  agreement and what trading restrictions we may or may not have in place. Global contracts uses this database to confirm their financial contract  records and approval for online trading. For both Houston and London we use the database to communicate with our  Clients, whether traders or  back office support people. Employees outside  legal have  limited view access only to see all the information except the  confidential Legal and Credit comments. They have no edit capabilities. The  database also has some reporting functions that we and London Legal have  found helpful. You should have gotten my email to Mike Neves, out database coordinator  requesting full edit access for you. It usually takes a few days. Once you  get access maybe you could find some time to surf the database, and we can  figure out how to get your ISDA data inputted..  Are you coming to the ENA Legal Conference in October?

There is no Excel spreadsheet to follow. 2. Duke Energy Corporation. At Mark's direction, I am sending his note  below regarding utilities. Again, until we do the due diligence on a utility  counterparty we have no way of knowing what kind of local, state or federal  regulation or approvals they may be subject to. We currently have masters  in place with only about 10 utilities/govt's. We are in the process of  negotiating another 30. Until those masters are executed and we have the  relevant resolutions, authority documents and/or legal opinions, I cannot  approve them for online trading. I have made every effort to search company  websites and elicit from Credit whether a counterparty is a regulated utility  or not. If I cannot tell by the information available to me, additional due  diligence will be needed to see if they are subject to local, state, or  federal regulation. Mark can override any decision I have made, I can only  make decisions within the guidelines the attorneys have set for me. 3. Montana Power Trading and Marketing Company is a subsidiary of a  regulated utility. I am unable to determine from Credit or their website  what type of regulation they might be subject to. The note is true that  Credit says they are getting out of the business anyway. 4. Petrotemex. Per my conversations with Mark and our advice from counsel,  unlike U.S. and U.K. counterparties, Mexican counterparties are not able to  enter into derivative transactions unless their articles and bylaws  specifically provide for these types of transactions. We will not know this  until the due diligence is completed, so I am supposed to say ""no"" for  Mexican counterparties we do not have a master swap agreement in place with. 5. PSEG. It is an energy services company; however, it is also not an  eligible swap participant (or ""ESP""). CFTC regulation limits the derivatives  trading we may do to certain types of counterparties that meet certain  financial requirements (large, institutional type investors, companies,  banks, etc). Corporations and partnerships have to meet certain net worth  and asset levels or we cannot trade financially with them.

Tokyo Mitsubishi:  We are preparing amendments that would be added to to  the Online and regular confirmations when they go out to deal with the lack  of legal terms in the master to do anything but interest rate and currency  transactions. This should solve our problem so we should be able to open  them for trading any commodity. 7. Trinidad & Tobago:  same comment as #3 above. 8. UBS AG. They recently sold their book and got out of the energy  commodity business so we should not be doing anything but FX and interest  rate transactions with them.

I discussed this one with Mark and Bill, and we have  agreed to open up Aspect for all trading under the Master. 10.

We cannot do any other  trading with them without specific pre-approval via a new resolution from  their Board of Directors. So they are still ""no"" for online derivatives  trading. 11. Insurance Companies:  With respect to trading with insurance/reinsurance  companies without a master in place, these types of counterparties have  special authority/legal issues that the online trading process does not  address. When we do trades with this type of counterparty without a master  in place we get legal opinions, guarantees, articles of incorporation &  bylaws and other kinds of statutory documentation to evidence the approval  for this type of counterparties doing these types of transactions. All kinds  of special representations are also added to the contract based on the type  of counterparty. We therefore have to continue to say ""no"" to online trading  based on these special handling procedures. 12. Cox and Perkins:  We could say ""yes"" to online derivatives trading,  however, would have to treat them like any other counterparty we did not have  a master in place with. 13. Kinetic Resources. Ditto comment 12 above. 14. Midland Cogeneration. Still under review as to regulated utility status. 15. Praixair:  see comment #1 above. 16. Tembec. The bylaws of this corporation require that all contracts for  this counterparty must be executed by two officers from a list they provided  to us . I spoke to Mark about this and they could not trade online unless  their Password Application was signed by two of the officers as directed  above. Another way to solve this would be to get a special resolution from  Tembec's board of directors allowing only one individual to sign the Password  Application. Either way, you cannot trade online without meeting these  special signatory requirements. 17. EW Scripps. Same comment as #1 above. 18. Maritime Electric. Is a Canadian utility. No Trading. Critical Changes to my list:  1. Mexico:  Per our conversation, we are contacting outside counsel to  request legal advice as to whether online transactions are enforceable in  Mexico. However, we can still not do financial trading without having a  master in place. 2. Public Service Company of Colorado:  the person that signed the master  appears not to have the authority to sign the master, so until we get this  resolved, we are switching them to a ""no"". Per my meeting today with Credit:  I've got 38 we disagree on, either as to whether they're a regulated utility  or an eligible swap participant. I'll be working on those tomorrow and will  get back to you. My Review of Your List:  List #1  1. BP Exploration & Oil Inc.:  Originated from London Credit, missing from  your list. This is a counterparty that both Houston & London trade with. ECT has a master in place with them. Trades would roll under the ECT  Master. The master is the old ECT Form of master that limits the trading to  energy price swaps and options. No weather. Case of Credit override.5 2. Elf Trading:  Both ECT and ECT International have masters in place and  trade with this counterparty. Mark was going to talk to Louise about what to  do with these situations when we have more than one master in place. 3. Morgan Guaranty Trust Company of New York:  We've got several overlapping  issues I am going to have to talk to London about. First, here in the U.S.  Morgan got out of the energy commodity business. We, in fact, ""bought their  book"". We actually couldn't ""buy their book"" because of our low credit  rating relative to Morgan, so all their trades remain in place, 'tho all  payments go in and out through us and we act as servicer for their commodity  business. Their master with ECT is bad, it only covers energy price swap  (not options!) and does not have the trade option rep which means if we were  to do an option transaction with them we would have to do a fix similar to  the Tokyo Mitsubishi fix. Saying all that, I don't know what, if any,  trading Morgan continues to do outside the U.S. I need to talk to London and  find out. So Morgan right now is a big open issue. 4. Vitol S.A.:   Both Houston and London trade with this counterparty. Houston has a master with this counterparty. Trades should be done under the  master. The master does not cover weather, so this would be another case of  the Credit override. 5. Missing counterparties from 1st list:   (1) Wisconsin Electric Power  Company, no master in place, not approved for trading, it is a utility, (2)  Wisconsin Gas Company, no master in place, not approved for trading, it is a  utility, (3) Wisconsin Power and Light Company, we do have a master in place,  approved for all trading, except weather, which is not covered in the master,  would have to be a Credit override, (4) Xeron, Inc., no master in place,  approved for all trading.

Per our  discussion, it was my understanding that the GTC's would be attached to all  outgoing confirmations. That does not seem to be the general consensus. There seems to be feedback from London that is not the case, and Janice Moore  was also saying she didn't know if that's what the liquids people were going  to do. Bob Shults asked for your direction with these holdouts. 2. The issue of the credit in the masters being overriden. First, after our  discussions yesterday, we couldn't figure out a way they could change the  approval status within Credit from approved with a master to a ""B"" approved  GTC with credit. Second, Bob Shults thought that had been agreed to have the  credit overridefor all the product areas and I told him that financial was  still discussing this issue with Credit, so we would have to get back to  him. I guess the physical people are OK with that. I don't know what  discussions you have had with Jeff and Alan, but Bob Shults appears to want  to have this confirmed for him.

2467,_5817.subject,"This link should get you access to our Financial Trading, or ""Master Swap  Agreement"" database. This database lists all the master swap agreements we  have in place or have drafted in the US, London, Singapore, Japan, South  America, etc.. It is a very good resource to use when preparing  confirmations. This database is available to all Enron employees, so feel  free to send this link to any London employees you think might find it  helpful. There are certain comments concerning the status of masters under  negotiation that are only available to Legal and Credit employees because of  legal-client confidentiality concerns. Any member of your legal team should  be able to look at those comments to determine if there is active/close  negotiation on a master, or if a master is being amended, what the amendments  might address (sometimes helpful when Houston isn't at work yet!). Frequently there may be more than one master in place for an Enron company,  so look at each entry to determine whether the master is limited to a  specific finance project or product (unusual, but sometimes). Also, as I  mentioned, not all the US based masters are ISDA Multi-Currency Masters, so  look to confirm what type of master we entered into. If they are not ISDA  Multi-Currency Masters, it may not be possible to put a cross-border trade  under the master without some modification to the master or confirmation. Please note:  there is a listing for ""Restrictions"" which will reflect any  trading limitations such as ""crude oil trades only"", ""no trades over 2  years"", contain special confirmation issues or list other types of trading  limitations. Restrictions should ALWAYS be looked at because they contain  critical trading guidance. Another note to watch out for is that many US  based master may have Texas law instead of NY. Certainly not UK law. We  hope to have that information available in the database in the future. If for some reason you can't access this database, let me know and we'll get  our respective computer people to figure out why.

As you can see when you look at our ""Deemed ISDA"" form of confirmation, there  are a number of provisions that our Deemed ISDA form of confirmation  includes, such as authority and tax representations, ""arm's length  transaction"" reps, acting as a principal rep, the deletion of section  2(c)(ii) of the ISDA Schedule (netting ""in respect of the same transaction""),  no language that each party has a copy of the ISDA form and has read it and  understands it, your deletion of language re: written confirmations,  definition of ""Transaction"" meaning the GTC+ISDA form+website terms,  ""Website"" (uppercased) is a defined term under the Password Application, we  usually say ""Loss"" instead of ""Market Quotation"", also,  Market Quotation and  Second Method will apply for the purposes of Section 6(e), a question, do we  need the word ""integrated"" with respect to the rerenced that the documents  contain a ""single agreement"" to fall under the U.S. bankruptcy swap  protection?, no ducment conflict provisions, missing our ""severability"" and  ""setoff"" language, no adoption of the 1991 or 1993 Commodity definitions,  business day defined as Sydney only, etc. Of course, you do not have these in your form of GTC, because they are or  will be covered in your executed ISDA Master Agreement, but it is likely  counterparties outside of Australia may not have a master swap agreement in  place.

What follows below are the extracts from two recent articles on  the power situation in India published by The Financial Times. The first article describes recent power outage in northern India affecting  millions of people. One possible line of defense is pointing out to the value of  output lost due  to  power shortages. It is obvious that the value of lost production exceeds the cost  of power produced by the Dhabol plant (expensive as it may be). The power cut affected 230  million people. The second article is Enron specific. Vince                                            ASIA-PACIFIC: Power failure hits north India                       Financial Times; Jan 3, 2001                      By ANGUS DONALD                       Tens of millions of people were left without electricity  in northern India                      yesterday after a power grid breakdown. Electricity was gradually switched on in some areas and  most parts of the                      capital New Delhi, with 60 to 70 per cent of supply  expected to be restored                      by the end of the day, according to power grid  officials. The Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry  (Assocham), a                      leading business organisation, expressed ""deep concern""  and called for a                      mechanism to prevent future disruption that could  ""cripple the economy"". The power failure across eight Indian states, including  New Delhi, disrupted                      train services, water supplies and the telephone network  and forced                      hospitals to switch to emergency generators. The fault occurred on the Northern Grid, which provides  electricity for 226m                      people, and affected the states of Delhi, Haryana,  Punjab, Uttar Pradesh,                      Himachal Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Jammu  and Kashmir. A breakdown at a sub-station in Kanpur in Uttar Pradesh,  India's most                      populous state, caused an overload of power on other  lines, which then                      failed as well. Trains stopped running for most of the day and signals  systems were                      damaged. New Delhi international airport was also  slightly affected before                      its own power supply could be engaged. ""We will probe into the reasons for the failure. It is  most likely to be a                      technical failure, but we will investigate why it  happened,"" Suresh Prabhu,                      the power minister, was quoted as saying by Press Trust  of India. India suffers regularly from power problems because of  lack of funding to                      upgrade infrastructure. Theft of supplies is also a big  problem. Thirty per                      cent of the country's electricity is stolen, according  to analysts. In New                      Delhi as much as 50 per cent is stolen. Two years ago, a power failure blacked out Uttar Pradesh  and Delhi for                      hours. Assocham issued a statement, saying that increasing  industrial demand                      would exacerbate the problems already faced by India's  inefficient power                      sector. ""The slow progress, particularly in  strengthening the transmission                      and distribution system, and ever increasing theft will  contribute to                      worsening the power supply situation further.""

Its ""myth and reality"" offensive in local newspapers  follows the west Indian                      state of Maharashtra's decision to review the tariff it  pays the Texas-based                      company, whose Dollars 2.2bn electricity generating  plant at Dabhol is                      India's biggest single foreign investment. Maharashtra's tariff has more than doubled since 1993  and is three times                      greater than that charged by other independent power  producers (IPPs). The tariff has risen because of the depreciation of the  rupee against the                      dollar and the high but now falling price of naphtha  fuel. The state also pays                      a fixed capacity charge of Rs970m (Dollars 21m) a month,  reflecting the                      huge project cost and, controversially, irrespective of  consumption. A showdown looks inevitable, reminiscent of a clash six  years ago that                      damaged India's appeal to foreign investors. A former  official of the World                      Bank, which has criticised the deal, says Enron is  emerging ""as the East                      India Company of the 21st century"" - a reference to the  British trader that                      colonised key areas of the Indian economy in the 19th  century. The stand-off is the latest blot on India's power  sector. The UK's PowerGen                      and Cogentrix of the US have quit India recently,  frustrated by long approval                      procedures, inadequate payments mechanisms or because of  higher                      returns elsewhere. ""India has lost time and opportunity and has driven  returns down by six                      percentage points,"" says Gerry Grove-White, former India  general manager                      of PowerGen, which has sold its 655MW plant in Gujarat  to China Light &                      Power of Hong Kong. India's national plan for the five years to 2002 says  generating capacity                      must rise by 40,000MW to about 120,000MW. But since  1992, IPPs have                      added only 3,000MW and 2,500MW remains under  construction. This is                      insufficient to support official projections of 6 to 8  per cent economic                      growth. Enron was a bellwether of India's liberalisation,  winning fast-track project                      approval in the early 1990s. Phase 1, a 740MW plant  fuelled by expensive                      naphtha came on stream in May 1999, and phase 2, a  Dollars 1.87bn plant                      of 1,624MW capacity that will run on cheaper liquefied  natural gas (LNG),                      will be completed this year. Only two of seven other  fast-track proposals                      have achieved financial closure. From the outset Enron encountered attacks, culminating  in Maharashtra's                      then nationalist government cancelling the project  before renegotiating                      terms no less onerous. Vilasrao Deshmukh, chief minister  of the successor                      government, says the power purchase agreement is  unaffordable. Enron, whose attackers also include cultural  chauvinists, wants to maintain                      good political relations in a hostile but lucrative  environment. Enron views                      India as a testing ground for its evolution from a  traditional manager of                      power plants to a broad-based trader of commodities,  such as energy, gas                      and bandwidth. To support these ambitions Enron hopes to trade energy  between power                      surplus and deficit states, once legislation is passed  this year. It is building                      an LNG terminal and pipelines to trade imported natural  gas. And it is                      laying a 15,000km fibre-optic network to trade bandwidth  space in a country                      desperately short of this new economy commodity. In any event, Enron believes it has a watertight  contract. It is supported by                      many that believe any subversion of the contract would  confirm investor                      perception of Maharashtra, India's financial and  industrial hub, as an                      unreliable destination for investment. Mr Deshmukh - who has avoided the language of his  predecessor, which                      threatened to ""dump Dabhol into the Arabian Sea"" - is  under pressure from                      radical members of his wobbly coalition. But his options  are limited. Scrapping the project would be ruinous for an  economically troubled state                      that would have to compensate shareholders. Maharashtra State Electricity Board, the local utility  and Enron's main                      client, is obliged to dispatch or ""off-take"" 90 per cent  of Dabhol's output. Yet                      MSEB has never honoured these guarantees. Its off-take  has averaged 60                      per cent since the plant opened and, in effect, MSEB has  been paying a lot                      more while consuming a lot less power. One reason off-take is low is because the state's tough  new regulator has                      told MSEB to buy from cheaper sources. Enron says the  tariff would be                      Rs4.02/kWh if MSEB's off-take averaged 90 per cent. But  with off-take a                      third lower, the average tariff is Rs4.94 per unit, and  often higher. In                      October, the tariff was Rs6.91 per unit, when off-take  was about 49 per                      cent. Enron says tariffs should come down when phase 2,  run on cheaper                      LNG, starts. These cost pressures have forced MSEB to take up only  half of a 30 per                      cent equity option in phase 2. Enron has acquired the  balance and                      mandated bankers to find a buyer. Enron's difficulties have undermined the appeal of IPPs,  which have failed to                      deliver the flood of investments. Potential IPPs feared  they would never be                      paid by state generating boards that have become a  byword for corrupt                      management of power. Reform of state electricity boards, whose uneconomic  pricing means                      industrial users subsidise poor farmers, as well as  transmission and                      distribution (T&D) services to check huge theft and  technical losses, is                      overdue. ""Given the limited resources, money would be  better spent on T&D                      rather than on new plant,"" says Oliver Blackaby,  managing director of N M                      Rothschild in India, which is advising Karnataka on the  privatisation of its                      distribution network. For the moment, attention is fixed on Enron's ability to  satisfy the                      competing interests of investors and clients. As Sanjay  Bhatnagar, chief                      executive officer of Enron India, said in a recent trade  magazine, one of the                      key lessons learned from phase 2 is ""having flexibility  to deal with                      externalities"".

Tom is a Corporate  Relations Officer at Wharton. Recommendation. I am writing to you to recommend joining The Wharton Partnership. The Partnership is an umbrella program established to coordinate Wharton School initiatives for industry-academic cooperation. Currently, the partnership supports alliances with approximately  200 companies  worldwide. The recommended annual contribution by Enron is between $100K-150K, that puts us in the top bracket of contributing companies, such as GE,  Citigroup, Goldman, Sachs & Co., Intel, and many others. The contribution is executed  through grants to different research projects that would directly benefit Enron. The  choice of the projects is at our discretion and can be changed over time depending on the business needs. Benefits to Enron. Enron can benefit from the Partnership by:   - gaining advance access to current academic research    - significantly increasing our presence  and visibility on the campus,    enhancing   our recruiting efforts  - taking our message directly to influential academics who have significant                    influence on public opinion         - gaining access to high quality executive education programs  Specific Programs. The Partnership functions through involvement in different research projects. I have identified a few projects that will maximize the benefit to Enron. 1. WeBI (Wharton e-Business Initiative). This programs provides an umbrella     for different initiatives in the area of curriculum development, research  and      corporate engagement related to e-commerce. Main benefits: access to e-commerce research and     enhanced recruitment opportunities. 2. Emerging Technologies Management Research Program. Interdisciplinary     program addressing issues facing companies in new markets: managing  intellectual     property, participating in emerging technologies, selecting the optimal     organizational structures. Benefits to Enron: access to financial technology in the area of  valuation of     intangible assets and new forms of business organizations. 3. Risk Management and Decision Process Center. Development of techniques for     assessment and management of non-traditional risks (risks outside the  scope     of traditional insurance contracts and capital markets instruments). Benefits to Enron: access to new risk management tools, dissemination     of information about our capabilities in this area. Potential users of the program at Enron.

As you know, Dale Surbey, who was managing the London unit of the Research  Group, is moving to EBS. Dale did a terrific job helping me to develop the pool of  talent we have currently in London. Given that Dale is likely to be transfered to Houston,  it's time to nominate one member of the Research Group for a management position. My recommendation is Steve Leppard. Steve emerged not only as the most technically qualified member of the group  but also as a natural leader,  highly respected by his peers and internal customers. Steve has a very high energy  level and is very efficient as a manager and as  coach of new talent. His promotion is likely to cause Anjam's departure form Enron. I value  technical skills of Anjam, but in spite of my loyalty to him, don't think he is the  same caliber as Steve. However, I would not like to lose him and think about moving him to  Houston for 2 years. I think that the opportunity to work in Houston, would be a  sufficient incentive to keep him in Enron.

We had also great help from Cantekin and Kirstee. We want to  validate some  inputs before releasing the number. Specifically, I want to make sure that both  London and Houston work with the same position numbers every day to avoid confusion. A few comments. 1. We plan to set up the models to run VaR concurrently in Houston  (Cantekin)  and London (Kirstee) with the same inputs. The reason to do it this way is that we may have to respond quickly to  multiple inquiries in both locations. (Cantekin and Kirstee, please stay in touch and synchronize the inputs ). 2. It is critical that we run the model daily and receive the updated  positions and prices on a regular basis. 3. We shall continue work in Houston to improve the model. Two critical areas:   a. VaR model, by its nature, does not capture one big risk MG has in its  portfolios. This is the liquidity risk        resulting from different cash consequences of the hedges and the  underlying positions. b. We should go through due diligence to validate the process generating  the position numbers (i.e. look                       into the details of specific transactions). From what  I know, MG has a fairly rudimentary risk        management system and I am not quite sure how they generate option  prices (and deltas). They get some                       option prices by calling brokers. 4. I think the current VaR is within 80-85% of the true number (assuming the  inputs are right). But, as I have said,      VaR does not capture all the risks that we have to worry about. Vince",MG VaR,kaminski-v

Enron's president and                     chief operating officer is engineering a fundamental  strategy shift at the                     Houston energy company, aimed at making it a dominant  ""new economy""                     player across various industrial markets. The Dollars 446m acquisition last month of MG, the  UK-based metals trader,                     is only the first of more than Dollars 1bn in estimated  new investments the                     company is targeting. It is seeking vehicles on which to  build                     business-to-business (B2B) platforms in sectors such as  logistics, chemicals,                     agricultural products and pulp & paper. Mr Skilling wants to take the business model the company  developed in                     natural gas and power and apply it to other wholesale  commodity markets. He                     argues the electronic platforms it creates will not only  become the principal                     B2B sites for those sectors, but reshape those  industries. As an example, he points to Enron's new e-commerce  platform, EnronOnline,                     which has changed the way the company does business with  its customers                     while significantly increasing sales. The company - the largest wholesale merchant of natural  gas and power - saw                     wholesale, physical deliveries of natural gas surge 53  per cent in the first                     quarter. Critics argue that Enron's move away from its familiar  energy business into                     new industries, where the learning curve is steep and the  competition                     entrenched, is risky. Yet a number of industry analysts  point out Enron has                     proved it understands markets and how to manage risks  while becoming the                     largest importer of coal in the UK, the largest trader of  gas and power in the                     US and grabbing an advantage in bandwidth. ""It's a prudent strategy, but it's got to be done in an  orderly way,"" says Ronald                     Barone, analyst with Paine-Webber in New York. ""What  they're doing here is                     what they've been incredibly successful at doing,"" he  adds, noting that Enron                     posted Dollars 1.3bn in earnings before interest and  taxes (ebit) from its                     wholesale energy and services business in 1999, up 34 per  cent from the                     previous year. Earnings from that division accounted for two-thirds of  the company's overall                     income before interest and taxes last year, and Mr Barone  sees the unit's ebit                     increasing 15-30 per cent annually over several years. As with gas and power and now broadband, where Enron is  standardising                     contracts and creating a market in bandwidth, it wants to  create markets by                     entering as a physical player and providing merchant,  risk management and                     financial services over the internet. ""We will provide electronic commerce, but we will provide  liquidity and we will                     provide settlement, or fulfilment of that contract,"" Mr  Skilling says. ""That is an                     extremely powerful model. If you look at other B2B sites,  they don't do that."" Mr Skilling argues Enron's e-commerce platform will  triumph over the other,                     bulletin board-type exchanges, where striking a deal  depends on two parties                     hooking up and working through uncertainties over timing,  price, credit and                     fulfilment. Not everyone shares that view. Some energy companies, for  example, would                     rather not do business with a competitor. BP Amoco  recently purchased a 3                     per cent stake in Altra Energy Technologies, a Houston-  based, neutral                     wholesale energy exchange. With Koch Industries and  American Electric                     Power, it also committed to carry out a fixed volume of  transactions on the                     site to lend it liquidity. Just as in gas and power and now broadband and metals,  Enron believes it                     needs networks of strategic physical assets. In acquiring  MG, Enron got a                     stable of warehouses, lending it a strong physical  position. ""It should provide (MG) with a more vibrant, more active  physical spot market                     in more markets in the world,"" says Greg Whalley, chief  executive officer of                     Enron Net Works, the new division Enron is launching to  identify and enter                     commodity markets. He argues that in metals and other  markets, Enron will                     deliver better pricing, price risk management services,  cross-commodity                     transactions and flexible transactions for a wider range  of customers. Mr Skilling says there are significant rewards for  restructuring an industry. ""If you can take that platform, and you use the  capabilities the bricks bring to                     the table, e-commerce the industry and change the  structure, you're selling for                     more than a 50 multiple.""

2709,_250.subject,"David,  During today's VaR coordination meeting  we had a discussion of issues  related to mapping of the forward price curves into core locations. Mapping is a  necessity dictated by the limitations of the computer system: we have to reduce the dimensionality of the problem to stay within the bounds of available CPU memory. Also, in some cases the quality of price discovery  is poor  and it's difficult to model the price curves independently: we solve the  problem by mapping them into more liquid and better behaved core  locations curves. We have agreed on the following:  1. Winston will investigate the IT side and determine to what extent we can  increase the number of forward price curves that are simulated as basic (core) curves. He will  investigate the impact of a larger number of the core curves on the time required to complete the VaR run. 2. The curves associated with the biggest 10-20 positions in each commodity  should be modeled as core curves (i.e. no mapping into other locations). It makes sense  to monitor the biggest risks separately and avoid aggregating them into  less  transparent aggregates. 3. The results of an automated clustering (mapping) procedures should be  systematically monitored by a human and corrected if they misrepresent the risks of the  trading positions. This responsibility should be vested with one person (right now the  responsibility is dispersed through the organization and this means in practice that nobody is responsible). Research can allocate one person to this task; cooperation of trading and RAC will be critical. Vince",VaR,kaminski-v

A separate message about  this visit will follow. I would like also to talk to you  about the way we manage our relationships  with different universities. Historically, we were rather passive customers of the academic institutions, trying to hire the best students and limiting our  presence on the campuses mostly to the recruiting trips and campus receptions. We should rethink the way we work  with universities. The efforts to get  the best students look more and more like a hand-to-hand combat and often we  are not very successful. It is critical that we increase our presence on the campuses and this can be accomplished in a number of different ways:  1. Involvement in research projects. For  example, we are currently   underwriting two research projects at Stanford University, involving  Ph.D. students of Professor   Nicholas Bambos (a top expert on communications networks). We shall participate in formulation of the projects' objectives and will be given access to the results. Involvement in research projects allows us to obtain  access to current scientific developments in the leading universities and  also to lock-up some very promising students. Most companies in the high tech industries have such  programs. 2. Lectures and presentations by Enron employees. Practically every  presentation I have made so far at different universities resulted in a number of resumes  and hiring decisions. It is important that students get exposed to Enron early in their academic  program. In many cases, the best students have already made up their mind by the time we approach  them during their  senior years. 3. Visits by faculty members in Enron. Closer cooperation with the universities has many advantages in addition to  getting the best students",Managing Enron's relationships with the universities,kaminski-v

2720,_3987.subject,"Reviewed by Mark Williams, SVP Risk Management, Citizens Power  The long awaited second edition of Managing Energy Price Risk has finally arrived. It has been four years since the first edition was published. During this hiatus, a lot has happened as risk management within the rapidly expanding energy industry has come of age as a respected discipline. The second edition is a rich compilation of papers by a surprisingly representative group of industry leaders, practitioners and academics. The books strength is that it reinforces the fact that risk management principles initially applied to a narrow band of energy commodities can and should be applied across a wide array of energy commodities including electricity. As expected the book does a solid job in capturing an international perspective on the various challenges, which are not isolated to any one continent but are global in scope. It includes a lengthy introduction that effectively frames risk management progress, advancements and innovations that started in the oil markets in the 1970's and migrated to the natural gas and most recently expanding to the electricity industry. Managing Energy Price Risk is comprised of 15 chapters, all of which include an introduction, which minimises the disjointedness that you may expect from a book written by a large number of authors. Other improvements in this second edition include expanded graphics, highlighted panels, detailed appendices and a separate glossary, which provides the reader with additional reference material. In particular the chapter on energy options written by Michael Hampton is a useful primer and provides the reader with a concise explanation of option theory, pricing, basis risk, delta hedging as well as practical guidelines for distinguishing between hedging and pure speculation. For the more advanced reader, the chapter on Energy Exotic Options, written by Vince Kaminski, Stinson Gibner and Krishnarao Pinnamaneni is particularly strong as it outlines the challenges associated with the exotics and effectively documents the latest methods used by leading practitioners in pricing such instruments. Additionally, the chapter on Accounting for Derivative Contracts in the Energy Environment by three consultants from Arthur Anderson, is a well written summary which addresses the numerous tax related issues including a timely discussion on the US Financial Accounting Standards Board's Statement 133 (see EPRM October 1999, page 22). Having this tax information housed in one concise chapter is of great value. The second edition however is not without flaws. In particular, it would have been useful to have more information on the current challenges risk managers are confronted with in the power industry including latest advancements in volatility and correlation estimation techniques. Additional attention could have also been placed on the shortcomings of the current market structure and methods in finding and applying appropriate hedging strategies and instruments. In the fledgling power market, this continues to be one of the primary challenges. In summary, this second edition of Managing Energy Price Risk builds upon the sentinel work laid out in the prior edition and is a valuable reference book for the new recruit or seasoned veteran. It is a welcome edition to any risk management library.",Book review,kaminski-v

The new economy, they  claim, requires                     new principles of valuation. C.com is one of the most exciting prospects in  business-to-business                     commerce. It is the world leader in a growing market -  annual sales by 2010                     are likely to be Dollars 500,000bn. If C.com can maintain  a 5 per cent share                     and earn only 1 per cent net margin its prospective  annual earnings will be                     Dollars 250bn. If we assume that market growth after 2010 is 5 per cent  and discount future                     revenues at 10 per cent, the prospective value of C.com  is Dollars 5,000bn -                     about 10 times the recent market capitalisation of  Microsoft, Cisco or General                     Electric. You don't have to wait for the IPO. You can buy shares in  C.com right now for                     less than 5 per cent of that value. C.com is called  Citigroup and in addition to                     its foreign exchange trading, which is the business I  have described, you get                     its other wholesale, retail and investment banking  activities and a leading                     insurance company thrown in. Of course, nobody would be so stupid as to value  Citigroup in this way. Yet I                     have followed more or less exactly the methodology  recommended in the                     latest McKinsey quarterly for the valuation of new era  companies. They use                     precisely analogous calculations to arrive at a valuation  of Dollars 37bn for                     Amazon.com. Paul Gibbs, head of merger and acquisition research at  J.P. Morgan, recently                     used similar principles to confirm that assessment of  Amazon. He then                     performed the same calculation for internet service  provider Freeserve. Assume that UK retail sales grow at 5 per cent a year,  that 25 per cent of                     sales take place on the net, that portals capture 50 per  cent of these, that                     Freeserve gets 30 per cent of the portal share and  maintains an 8 per cent                     commission on sales. Multiply these together and you  establish that in 2017                     Freeserve will make profits of o2bn (Dollars 3.2bn). This, he argues, justifies a                     value today of o6.50 per share.",Valuation of Internet companies,kaminski-v

He is very pragmatic and, also, I expect a cool head on old       shoulders. One negative is that he wants to work out of New York. The tradeoff is  between      maintaining  his contacts and working closer with the desks. 2. Tony Mends. I think you, or Louise, should explore the possibility of  using the skills of Tony Mends.

2805,_1444.subject,"Per our discussion this morning, below is a summary of items to discuss with  Glynn:  Adding Enron's ""negative CTC claim"" to the list of claims: PGE's filing  included a list of top twenty creditors. Our negative CTC claim was  apparently not taken into account in compiling that list. The list is  nonbinding, however. PG&E will be required to file schedules of creditors on  April 20. Our negative CTC claim should be on Schedule F (for unsecured  claims). You may want to remind Glynn of your previous conversations and  state our expectation that the negative CTC claim will appear (preferably as  uncontested) in the April 20 filing. (Note: if PG&E does not include the  claim we have an opportunity to file a proof of claim and ultimately the  court determines the validity of the claim). Including Enron on the Creditors' Committee:  PG&E may have the opportunity  to influence representation on the creditors' committees. There are several  reasons to suggest to Glynn that we be included: 1) we are a big creditor, 2)  we could be helpful in crafting a broader solution, and 3) we are one of the  real parties in interest behind the PX and ISO (who were listed as  significant creditors but are really just ""passthroughs"" for the suppliers  ... and PG&E likely would not want to have those political bodies serving on  the creditors committee anyway).",Call to Bob Glynn,kean-s

Says teams in Washington have all the demand curves from the utilities (from  which to calculate offering prices). QF meeting starts at 7:00 pm tonight. says average cost of QFs today is 15?/kwh (amounts to 30% of supply). believes that cost can be brought down significantly if gas is purchased  forward (perhaps by state entity). Says all utility generation (another 30%), mostly hydro and nuclear is cost  based at  4?/kwh. If suppliers come in at 5.5? (or even 6? ), there is room under the 7? new  commodity rate component to recover securitized costs (amounts to about 40%  of SCE supply). Says good progress was made today. Believes they may have a framework this  evening. Believes 5.5? is causing problem; maybe room to squeeze it up (perhaps as  high as 6.0?). Thinks governor will slightly increase rates (or pay more at government  facilities) if the parties can get 97% of the way to a solution. Thinks it's nearly a ""done deal"" that DWR (state entity) will buy power. Says securitization may be harder to get.

2830,_2486.subject,"The letter looks good. A couple of comments for your consideration:  On page three we describe the change to the definition of Public Utility and  then argue that we don't fit into it. Would it be worth explaining why that  makes sense? Specifically, the New Jersey restructuring law, like most  efforts of its kind in other markets, is designed to separate the competitive  from monopoly elements of the power (and gas) businesses. Economic  regulation would then be restricted to the remaining monopoly elements of the  business (eg distribution). The competitive market can not be solely relied  upon to ""regulate"" the behavior of monopoly asset owners, such as  distribution utilities. Therefore, regulators continue to be called upon to  set pricing and other terms of service. What those regulators decide matters  a great deal to those monopoly utilities and it consequently makes sense for  lawmakers to be concerned about attempts by such entities to use campaign  contributions to tacitly influence decision makers. The same public policies  simply do not apply to that portion of the market which is competitive. The  generation and sales business has a competitive structure (i.e. relatively  low barriers to entry, multiple competitors etc.). These components of the  power and gas business can be ""regulated"" by the market with respect to rates  and terms of service. They do not require economic regulation any more than  grocery stores, department stores, appliance sellers or other ""retailers""  (who presumably are not prohibited from making contributions. Competition  and markets discipline behavior and establish competitive prices and terms of  service. Because regulators don't set the prices and terms of service for  such sellers, there is no reason to be concerned about campaign  contribuitions from such organizations. Indeed, the legislation, and the  legislative history, clearly conform to this underlying policy rationale. As a former practicing lawyer, I certainly understand the value of pleading  in the alternative. But, I question how certain of our arguments woud be  perceived by the public if they ever came to light (which these documents  have a habit of doing).. . I can just see the press seizing on Enron's claim  of ""ignorance or mistake"" or the fact that we pled for the favorable exercise  of ""prosecutorial discretion"". I suggest that we add whatever we feel is  necessary to the very solid looking intent argument, not make specific  reference to ""ignorance or mistake"", and not plead for the favorable  esxercise of PD.

I have been giving the Chamber a bit of a hard time lately and  wanted you to know why. I have been in touch with both Tom and his staff over the last year. Donahue  has done a very good job raising money and getting his membership rolls up,  both in terms of membership and dollar contribution per member. My  reservation about the Chamber is that they won't take a stand on something  which is in the best interests of the vast majority of their membership if it  will alienate a vocal few. Electric restructuring was a key example of  this. There was no doubt where they should have been on the issue, but  instead of embracing retail open access legislation at the federal level they  decided to have a ""process"". Naturally, all the utilities volunteered to  participate in the process and outnumbered the nonutility members when it  came time to vote. The vote supported wholesale, but not retail, reform  (with heavy emphasis on ensuring stranded cost recovery). Afterwards, the  federal debate shifted solely to wholesale legislation (though this is not  exclusively the Chamber's fault). Unfortunately, Tom's forceful and competitive approach when it comes to  raising his membership rolls leaves him unwilling to do the right thing if a  few members will be upset.

Where we run into problems, my gut tells me, is that we have  some difficulty getting the very best from the very best schools (ie we often  lose out to the I-Banks and, perhaps McKinsey-level consulting firms) and  that we have a tough time holding the most talented managers and directors  (ie we're OK at the top livels already).

2878,_5.subject,"Hello , my name is Tori Kuykendall (One Pass BJ927934). My husband, Patrick(  One Pass VF751282), and I have been One Pass members for a few years now as  well as elite members on several occasions. We also use Chase Continental  Visa exclusively, and my husband is a President's Club member. I have made  Continental my airline of choice for as long as I can remember booking my own  travel arrangements and have been a very satisfied customer in the past. This morning, however, I had a very bad experience. I booked tickets for a  vacation back on September 4th for a trip from Houston to New York on  December 1. Since I booked the ticket, I became pregnant and found out from  my doctor last week that I will still be unable to travel on December 1st due  to complications with my pregnancy. My doctor indicated to me that I may not  be able to fly at all during my pregnancy, which is due to end in June. I  spoke to Leroy Peterson this morning to explain the situation, and he  indicated that all he could do was give me credit that would expire on  September 5th, 2001 and that a $75 service would be charged to me next time I  book a ticket for me or my husband. I understand that this is the same  policy that you would have given me if I had just decided that I didn't feel  like taking a vacation this weekend. In my opinion, this is an unacceptable  policy in the event of medical complications. As you can see with my  situation, it is unlikely that my husband and I will be able to plan a  vacation by September of 2001 considering we will hopefully have a 2 month  old child. I repeatedly asked Leroy if there was anyone else who could help  me or anyone I could talk to in order to get some kind of exception to your  policy. I indicated that I could provide a doctor's note if necessary. He  was very rude to me, stating ""You don't have to ask me 7 different times for  the same thing - I already told you NO!"" I had to cancel a flight for work  about a month ago on Southwest airlines for the same reason, but I was hoping  that I would be able to fly again by now. For your information, your  competitor was very helpful. They accepted my doctor's note, gave me a  credit good for one year, and will allow me to change the ticket to another  person's name if I am still unable to use it. That ticket was also booked as  a non-refundable fare. Although I have always used Continental  for my  personal travel, the treatment I have had in this difficult time has  definitely made me second-guess my future choices. If there is anything you  can do to help, I would greatly appreciate it.",customer service complaint,kuykendall-t

Move the control and decision making of 5 Million of VAR each to the  trading heads of North America (Lavorato) and Europe (Sherriff). 3. With respect to North America I intend to create a group called the  ""Cross Commodity Trading Group"" which will warehouse the 5 Million of VAR and  use it as it sees fit (I will run this group and currently be the only  employee). This will start out as an administrative structure to use if we  need to throw more VAR at certain positions (I see the individual trading  groups staying within their VAR limits).

They would like Mark and Natalie to have the end or corner suite that the  Vittors have. Ken and Linda said that they would prefer two connecting rooms, hopefully on  the 3rd or 4th floor. They would like for the rooms to have the ocean view  on the North side. If that isn't possible, it would be o.k. to overlook the  pool, but they would not really like the south side as it wouldn't be as  quiet. The two rooms would give them everything they need, with 2 baths. They said they can be reached in Switzerland tomorrow.

Is Enron going to be just a trading company? 2.) If Enron is just a trading company our earnings could be quite  volatile. How could this affect our stock price? Will Wall Street be  prepared to accept more volatile earnings? 3.) Volume on EOL seems to be decreasing since the middle of the year and  new platforms are being introduced into the market place. Is this going to  have a negative effect on Enron's stock price? 4.) What are some of the new markets Enron plans to explore in the near  future? 5.)

Therefore, the resolution is we are responsible for these corrections. We  must get the deals entered into the system with the correct counterparty  initially.

We had a case  yesterday where a deal was originally entered at one location for the deal  and for the hedge. The point was incorrect and a person in logistics  corrected it. The problem occurs in that sitara looks to verify the  locations are the same on the deal and the hedge and if they are, it will  then value the deal in the trader's book at mid. If the locations are  different, it will value the deal at the customer price. This could  potentially have a large impact on the trader's P&L. It does not seem  pertinent to have your guys changing swap locations in addition to changing  deal locations due to time constraints.

Keep the PPA has streamlined as possible, putting as much as we can in  the interconnection agreement. 2. Minimize ties to specific unit. 3. Maximize optionality, especially delivery points. 4. Keep construction/ownership of the facility off the balance sheet. 5. Signing the interconnection agreement must be simultaneous, or a CP. More specifically we would like to:  Move start up/metering terms to interconnection agreement. Megawatts will probably change due to change in equipment. Bracket 192 for  now. The capacity will change for summer and winter, also, specifics to be  determined. Make sure we are protected from any liability caused by their delay. Comments on specific articles: Definition of emergency start up will belong in interconnection agreement. 2.2  Expiration is Dec. 31, 2004; move  bracketed language into interconnect. 2.3  We need an out in case we don't commence construction/achieve commercial  operation as a result of Buyer's action/inaction, and the term ""breach""  should include failure to timely perform any of buyer's obligations under any  of the agreements. Any reason why we shouldn't want an extension if there is  a delay due to action/inaction of any governmental authority? We can add  change of law as an event which gives us schedule relief, but we might want  to broaden the definition of change of law. Also, we don't have the site  acquired yet, so we may need an out in case we encounter a problem, unless we  will not sign this agreement before acquiring the site. 3.4  Peak period is July and August. 3.5 (b) Amount left over will depend on the summer and winter capacity.

One alternative has been to buy gas from the City of Rocky Mount, which has a  take or pay contract with the local supplier, and is not using all of their  gas, especially in the summer. We have developed a preliminary draft of the LOI, which I am attaching for  your review. I would appreciate the opportunity to discuss it with you to  get your input, etc. Of particular concern is that Rocky Mount wants ENA to  deal exclusively with them during the term of the LOI (this isn't reflected  in the draft).

EE&CC Legal should be involved in the beginning of the process of drafting  documents by EE&CC Contract Administration, unless other procedures have been  agreed. 2. Due to conflicts of interest, EE&CC Legal cannot represent NEPCO  while at  the same time working with the deal team. to procure equipment for the same  project.

EECC Legal and ENA Legal should communicate regarding issues common to  both companies so that consistency in position can be achieved as much as  possible.

3271,_2744.subject,"Did you know that one out of every 10 cars and trucks sold in the U.S. is a  Lexus or a Toyota? With the new Highlander, Toyota will easily cement itself  as one of the best-selling brands in North America. How can we be so sure? Because the Highlander represents an optimum blend of three utilitarian types  of vehicles: the station wagon, the minivan and the sport-utility vehicle. Based on the same platform as the Lexus RX 300, which itself is based on  modified Toyota Camry mechanicals, Highlander is longer, taller and wider  where the wheels meet the pavement than the Lexus. Despite its greater size,  the Highlander is lighter than the RX 300, so acceleration should equal or  better its upscale cousin. Braking will likely prove impressive, too. Highlander comes standard with four-wheel disc brakes equipped with  electronic brake force distribution (EBD) and brake assist (which maximizes  braking power during a panic stop). Highlander is rated to tow 3,500 pounds, when properly equipped. Helping to  meet that specification is the same 3.0-liter V6 that resides under the hood  of the RX. Making 220 horsepower at 5,800 rpm and 222 ft-lbs. of torque at  4,400 rpm, the V6 features Variable Valve Timing with intelligence (VVT-i). The standard engine, also using VVT-i to maximize power and efficiency, is a  2.4-liter inline four making 155 ponies and 163 ft-lbs. of twist. The  four-speed automatic transmission provides a ""snow mode"" for easy starts on  slippery surfaces. With 7.3 inches of ground clearance (6.9 on front-wheel drivers) and a fully  independent suspension front and rear, Highlander isn't designed to tackle  tough terrain. But it'll work great during heavy snowfalls. Toyota's Vehicle  Skid Control (VSC) system, which includes traction control, is optional, and  is designed to recognize when the Highlander isn't responding to the driver's  steering inputs. VSC will then apply selective braking to bring the truck  (car?) back under control. In the event it fails (not likely, but possible), Highlander protects  occupants with whiplash injury lessening (WIL) front seats, five three-point  seatbelts equipped with automatic and emergency locking retractors (ALR/ELR),  front seatbelts with pre-tensioners and force limiters and ISO-FIX child seat  anchors. Daytime running lights and side airbags are optional. Inside, Highlander delivers 38.5 cubic feet of cargo space with the rear  60/40 split folding seat in use, and a whopping 81.4 cubes when it's folded. Air conditioning, CD/cassette combo stereo with six speakers, cruise control,  tilt steering wheel, bottle holders, and grocery bag hooks are standard. Opting for Limited trim gives you JBL sound, automatic climate control,  remote keyless entry, woodgrain interior trim, alloy wheels with full-size  spare, fog lights, privacy glass and other upgraded features. Leather  upholstery is available on V6 models. Toyota is planning to sell 70,000 Highlanders in calendar year 2001. We'll  bet demand outstrips supply. B",Toyota Highlander review,mann-k

(""ENA"") regarding NorthWestern=01,s purchase thro= ugh=20 the LLC referred to below or as otherwise accomplished without violation of= =20 the Turbine Contract referred to below (the =01&Purchase=018) of two (2) Ge= neral=20 Electric (=01&GE=018) 7EA combustion turbines (the =01&Turbines=018), the f= irst of which=20 is presently located at a GE storage facility, and the second of which is= =20 scheduled to be available for delivery in February, 2002, and both of which= =20 are subject to purchase from GE under an agreement with GE dated as of May= =20 31, 2000 (the =01&Turbine Contract=018) with respect to which ENA has the r= ight to=20 cause a joint venture limited liability company in which, prior to commerci= al=20 operation of the Turbines, ENA holds a 20% equity interest and a wholly-own= ed=20 NorthWestern subsidiary (the =01&NorthWestern Subsidiary=018) holds an 80% = equity=20 interest (the =01&LLC=018) to become the purchaser:  1. Purchase Price:  NorthWestern will pay ENA $48.0 million for the Turbin= es=20 (subject to adjustment as described below). [Adjusted how? Need specific= =20 reference. Is the statement that the payment is for the turbines consistent= =20 with the structure? Definitely sounds like a UCC deal,  for what that=01,s= =20 worth.] 2. Closing Date of Purchase:  The Purchase will close on a date on or prio= r=20 to September 1, 2001, as selected by NorthWestern by not less than 30 days= =01,=20 written notice to ENA,(provided that such notice may not be given less than= =20 30 days after the signing of a definitive agreement relating to the=20 Purchase). [What happens at closing? Payment of the balance? In the=20 interim are we going to be obligated to perform under the GE contract in a= =20 certain manner? Are we taking on implied obligations to NW?] 3. Cash Down Payment:  NorthWestern will pay ENA an $8.0 million down=20 payment for the Turbines. The first installment ($3.0 million) of the $8.0= =20 million down payment will be due upon the signing of a definitive agreement= =20 with ENA providing for the Purchase. The second installment ($5.0 million)= =20 of the $8.0 million down payment will be due at the earlier of (i) closing = of=20 the Purchase, or (ii) July 15, 2001.

Liquidated Damages:   If, prior to the assignment of the Turbine Contra= ct=20 [is proper reference to closing? ], the purchaser under the Turbine Contract= =20 receives any liquidated damages under the Turbine Contract, then ENA will= =20 give notice thereof to NorthWestern as promptly as possible. [Then what?] 5. Carry Period:  ENA will provide an interest-free carry on the unpaid=20 purchase price of the Turbines until July 15, 2001. If the closing of the= =20 Purchase occurs after July 15, 2001, then the unpaid purchase price of the= =20 Turbines will be increased by interest at the rate of 7.5% per annum on the= =20 unpaid purchase price of the Turbines ($40.0 million) for each day from, an= d=20 including, July 15, 2001 to, but excluding, the closing date. 6. Dual Fuel Conversion on Unit 2:  ENA will not proceed with this change= =20 order to effect the conversion.

All obligations of the LLC under t= he=20 Turbine Contract, as well as all obligations of the NorthWestern Subsidiary= =20 to ENA in connection with the transaction, will be guaranteed by NorthWeste= rn=20 Corporation.

3378,_352.subject,"FPL, Entergy Merge in $7 Billion Deal  NEW YORK (Reuters) - FPL Group Inc., the parent of Florida Power & Light Co.,  said on Monday it would merge with Entergy Corp. in a stock deal worth $7  billion to create the largest U.S. power generating company. The combined company would have a total enterprise value of more than $27  billion, consisting of $16.4 billion in equity market capitalization and  $10.7 billion in debt and preferred stock, the companies said. The merger is expected to immediately boost earnings for both companies. Under the terms of the agreement, FPL shareholders would receive one share of  a new holding company for each FPL share held. Entergy shareholders would get  0.585 of a share of the new holding company for each Entergy share. Based on the companies' closing stock prices, the deal would value Entergy at  its market value of $7 billion, or about $30.89 per share. FPL shares closed  Friday at 52-13/16, off a year high of 56-5/8 but up from a low of 36-3/8. Entergy stock ended at 30-5/16, off a high of 31-3/16 but up from a low of  15-15/16. SHAREHOLDERS' APPROVAL REQUIRED  The combination must be cleared by shareholders as well as federal  regulators. FPL and Entergy said they hope to complete the transaction within  15 months. ``The merger combines two strategically aligned, financially healthy  companies into an organization that has no equal in the industry,'' said J.  Wayne Leonard, Entergy chief executive. Leonard will serve as president and chief executive of the combined company  while FPL's chief executive, James Broadhead, will serve as chairman. The deal was billed as a merger of equals but gives FPL shareholders 57  percent of the combined company and eight of 15 seats on the board of  directors, the companies said. Once combined, the new company is expected to see annual cost savings of $110  million to $150 million in its regulated businesses derived from eliminating  duplicate corporate and administrative positions and programs. Competitive businesses should see annual cost savings and revenue  enhancements of $40 million to $125 million and capital expenditure savings  of $50 million to $100 million, the companies said. FPL and Entergy said they will seek to ``minimize workforce effects of the  merger'' through a variety of unidentified efforts. In addition, both FPL and Entergy have authorized stock buyback plans,  together worth $1 billion. FPL plans to repurchase $570 million shares while  Entergy is looking to buy back $430 million in stock, the companies said.",FPL/Entergy merger news article,mann-k

Current language may be soft enough to not violate  licensing laws. 2.2 (g) cost of filing for licenses and permits not included in defn of  Marketing Expenses, but there's some catch all language that might help. 2.3  Accountants may like it to be clear that we can't hire/fire O & M  contractor, set O & M policies, or dispatch plant. 3.2   If there are multiple transactions in a short period, these may be  captured in one document, not one document for each transaction.

We have presented to People's  a nonphysical method to monetize it, similar to what was done with Bammel. Since this is a regulated asset, regulatory approval will be required, and  the consumers will receive part of the benefit of the monetization. The  essence of our deal is that Enron will receive 50% of the net earnings, up to  $25mm, as our fee. In consideration for this fee, Enron takes the financial,  legal, accounting and engineering lead. Peoples and Enron will work together  on the regulatory strategy formulation and implementation. We want to present a draft MOU to Peoples this week. The basic goals are:  Define scope of the agreement Define our lead role in the 4 stated areas Create exclusivity for Enron  Define financial arrangements (cost/profit) Get an acknowledgement that what was presented to them was proprietary, and  covered by our confidentiality agreement. Define term (5 years)   Each party bears their own internal costs, and third party costs are split  50/50, with prior approval. In that regard an immediate concern is getting  the engineering work kicked off. We want the agreement broad enough to cover physical withdrawals. We do not  want it specific to this field, since we want the benefit of the use of our  methodology. Please correct/supplement, etc. Thanks,",Manlove Monetization,mann-k

The purpose of this meeting is to pull everyone together for  an update on EGM and a brief presentation from all the business units within  EGM. This includes about 1 hour of business and then drinks and food - we  expect about 500 people. We have made a lot of progress on changing the nature and profitability of  these businesses and we want to make sure everyone sees just how far we have  come in a few months. I believe they will be motivated to see the growth and profitability. We had  a record Q1 with $100 million of gross margin. That was 50% of what they  made in all of 2000. Combined with the fact that in December of 2000 alone  we made $87 million in gross margin, I believe it will have a big impact. If you could attend the meeting even for a few minutes it would go a long way  in helping us drive our other point which is that the EGM businesses are now  core to Enron and has the attention of both you and Jeff.

3583,_18.subject,"Darrell,  I attempted to call you a few minutes ago (late night your time - but there  was no voicemail). I didn't want to wait several more days before I contact  you. I'm out all weekend. Eric shared with me some of your concerns about resources for a Korea LNG  opportunity. I certainly understand your view but wanted to share some of my  thoughts. Rick and/or Clay know the Asian LNG industry better than anyone  else in the company. They are very good and I have a lot of faith in them  and their ability to assess opportunities and develop projects. They are  lacking wholesale type of transaction experience that a few of the guys that  have recently come into the group have. That is why we have brought them  in. We have a very strong team and i like the mix a lot. Eric is the person we chose to run the group for many reasons but it wasn't'  done as a lack of faith in Rick or his original team. The biggest  opportunities and the viewpoint we must take in this business is running it  like a wholesale unit and running it as a portfolio of transactions and  books. That certainly doesn't  mean that 20 years of experience doesn't have  enormous value especially in the non-Atlantic markets. Rick is in the  process of coming back to Houston after the shut down of our middle east  projects and strategy. Rick is also in the process of assessing what exactly  he would like to do in the time of transition. My very sincere hope is that  he will stay in the LNG group and perform a very important role especially in  this type of development or deal making role. Especially  in a big deal in  Japan, Korea or something in the Asian area. We will discuss this next week  when he comes to town. I need Eric to be in Houston right now due to our Elba Island, Venezuela and  Bahamas immediate activity. He will certainly be engaged in everything but  he can not be focuses as much as you need in Korea or Joe needs in Japan. Please give me a call next week and we can discuss this in more detail.

It  needs some work. m    draft  John,  I have just had some additional discussions on our Global weather business  and have come to a decision on how we need to run the weather business. I  believe that we do  need 100% full time dedication from each and any employee  that is dedicated to the weather business including in the overall  development and execution of or global strategy and positions. I have a  great deal of confidence and am holding Mark Tawney responsible and  accountable for extensive growth and profitability in the business. We need to hire additional people to add to grow the business in Japan and  Australia. Joe and Paul are on board with this strategy and Mark will work  with them to accomplish the hiring of people and needed resources. This will  not be talk but we will get these people in place by specific deadlines. We  will pay all of those people's expenses and they will be on board with the  hiring and will be expected to be a valuable team player and resource to  their group. On the Norway front, we need to implement the same organization structure. We have talked a lot about Thor and better communication, but we need to make  a change. We will have weekly calls with him and the weather group to make  sure that we are all on the same page and he is up to speed with where we are  going. Jeff did have a video call with Thor to talk about his email and it  went well. Upon my return I learned that Thor and the London group put out a  press release about putting out pricing on 1,000 cities and even changing the  index. Neither Mark or Jeff were even aware of this event nor was it even  brought up in the call as something that was going to happen. Also the  hiring of xxxxxx as a weather  originator, without any discussion, also  illustrates the lack of communication or desire to work together. I am not  saying that Mark or Thor are totally to blame, they both deserve credit for  not working together, but  we are going to change the future and make sure  that it will work better. I know that all of Thor's group is very loyal to  Thor and may not want to transition into EGM and if that is the case, we can  make it work via London. I think the key is our approach to Thor and that  this isn't meant as a reflection on him but is a consistent change with how  we are running all of our businesses around the world. The weather piece of  his business is very small and isn't going to effect his P&L significantly  (he'll actually be net positive!) Please give me a call and we will discuss the issues surrounding this new  structure and the best way to communicate it to those involved to make this  the most effective.

3606,_30.subject,"John,  Here is a brief email on a possible resolution for the European/Oslo  weather  situation. Mark sent this draft to me last weekend but i haven't had time to  review it this week. Personally, I think that this is the wrong answer from  a Corporate perspective but this issue keeps hanging around and isn't worth  any more of our time. For what it is worth, I think our communication  strategy did make a big difference but didn't get us exactly where we needed  to be. These groups will be expected (and held accountable) for good and  consistent communication on an ongoing basis as well. For a P&L that is  this small (and negative) we are all spending too much time on this. There  is more to this story but I think we should just drop it and move on to  bigger and better things. I am certainly not wedded to any of this but would rather focus on all the  other issues and problems on my plate. Let's discuss upon your return on our  weekly call. Thanks and I hope your vacation was relaxing. Mike   ps-this hasn't been shared outside the group on the email.",European Weather,mcconnell-m

I am here at 35,000 feet 2,000 miles from Bankock Thailand, flying  by China,  soon to be over the Philippines and pondering our lives. You said something  very interesting to me on the phone as I was getting on the bus to the  airport. You said that you would love to have 6 hours on the airplane by  yourself. I can certainly understand that. I seem to have a l lot of that  on this trip. I am sitting here on the plane, a little tipsy after a couple  glasses of wine, and my mind turns to you and the kids. I wish I could be  there now to see the kids all dressed up in their costumes ready to go out  trick or treating. I bet they look great. As i sit here and feel a little sorry for myself then i come back to reality  and realize just how lucky we really are. I turned to Ken Rice at the  ceremony yesterday and said, ""What is an Okie and a boy from Nebraska doing  at a Japanese barrel ceremony with Thomas Foley, former Speaker of the House,  breaking a barrel of saki in front of 300 Japanese executives and TV. The  Prime Minister of Japan didn't show up and actually it is expected that he is  out of a job on a no confidence vote last night. (Really bad luck for Enron  here) I would have liked to have met him. Actually, the ceremony was neat  and I imagine that they will have some funny pictures from it. You should  see me in a Happy coat. I'll explain when i get home. Can you imagine sitting in our home, right after Michael was born and even  imagining what are lives are like today? We are so blessed. Even more than  that, I am so blessed to have you. I was writing in my journal on the trip  over, you know my journal - that project that I have dedicated a big part of  my life to and that you have never read, reflecting on our lives and  wondering why God let me find you so many years ago. I must have been a  priest in a former life. Anyway, I just wanted to say I love you and there aren't any phones on this  airplane. Thai Airlines, go figure. So I am calling you via email.

Cathy Phillips   It is my sincere honor to once again lead the Enron team in this year's  Juvenile Diabetes Foundation (JDF) walk scheduled to take place on Sunday,  November 5, 2000, at the Sam Houston Race Park. I continue to serve on the  board of JDF representing Enron and will be Enron's corporate executive for  this year's fundraising efforts. As many of you may already know, I am an insulin dependent diabetic myself. Even though I know how difficult this disease can be to manage with the  multiple finger pricks for blood samples and several shots each day, I cannot  imagine how difficult it is for a small child with this disease. Taking  insulin does not cure the disease nor prevent the development of  complications; insulin is simply their life support system and without it  they would die. Enron continues to be a major corporate sponsor for JDF again this year. JDF  is a very efficient organization in which approximately 84% of all money  raised goes directly to research. Enron's goal this year is to raise  $225,000 and we need your help. Enron has been the number 1 walk team for 5  years in a row and we are not ready to give up first place! We need team  leaders, walkers and volunteers to help us reach our goal. The theme for the  walk this year is ""Knock Out Diabetes"" and we would like to have you join us  for this great event. The Walk is truly a blast and we had about 500 Enron  people participate last year and everyone enjoyed it. If you are interested in volunteering to be a walker or a team leader, or if  you would like to make a pledge, you may call any of the steering committee  members listed below.

I  would appreciate your cooperation with the key move issues that are outlined  below:  IMPORTANT - A special building tour has been scheduled for the EGM business  unit heads receiving this message. Jeff and I, along with Bill Donovan,  would like to invite you to join us for a tour on this Friday morning, June  8th, from 8:30 to 9:30 a.m. Even if you have already had an opportunity to  visit the new building, we think this would be a great opportunity for all of  us to see the space together and discuss any issues at that time. Please  contact Cathy Phillips at X-36898 if you plan to attend the tour. New building floor plan modification requests will no longer be accepted. Any change requests that have already been received are currently being  considered and will be conveyed to the appropriate business unit head. If vacant positions exist and they will be filled before the move on August  3rd, they need to be identified on all reports and floor plans with their  name, NH (for new hire) and an approximate hire date. Example:  Bob Smith NH  7/25 Any space/move related questions or issues that may arise should be addressed  by Cathy Phillips. Please do not contact Susan Lopez for any space related  issues. Jeff and I have asked Cathy and Jennifer Burns to be responsible for  the allocation of space in the new building and they are keeping us well  informed as to the progress and any issues as they arise. Jeff and I are very aware that space is very tight in the new building and we  will be addressing growth and additional space needs and issues in the near  future. A limited number of Turret phones will be available in the new building. The  Turret phones will be assigned to traders and their assistants only. Everyone else on the floor will receive a new upgraded version of the Lucent  phone (with the existing phone numbers). Please contact Jennifer Burns if  you have any questions or issues related to phones. All private team rooms, offices and conference rooms have been assigned and  there are no more available for assignment to the individual groups or  people. On the 3rd floor we will have the following public conference space  available by making reservations (specific scheduling details to follow  later): 1 Mega conference room 1 Large conference room with videoconference capabilities 1 Large conference room - no videoconference  3 Team rooms File space on the floor is being upgraded and allocations of file space will  be made for each group. Every attempt is being made to have the assigned  file space as close to each individual group as possible. At this time, details related to food deliveries and distribution have not  been resolved. Your patience and flexibility with all food related issues  will be appreciated. It is highly probable that food service in the new  building will be very difficult at first and as we get closer to the move  date, more information will be provided related to food service, deliveries  and distribution. Since Jeff and I both already keep Cathy and Jennifer very busy, we would  appreciate it if you would send all your comments, questions, or issues to  them via e-mail. They have agreed to make themselves available every Monday  at 4:30 p.m. to meet with anyone to discuss their questions. Please make  arrangements with them directly to meet regarding your issues. There will be a 60 day freeze on any building changes once we move into the  new building. I understand that this is a difficult process and that there are a lot of  questions and issues, but Jeff and I are convinced that this will be great  and everything will work out in time.

Meeting with all key technologist on the full suite of products and  functionality with complete demonstration by i2. I would especially want PB,  JP, BP, HE, and JG from George's group. Follow-up meeting (after the technologists see functionality and form  opinions and possible applications) with key commercial leaders:  GP -  P&P;  TG - CommodityLogic; BG - Metals and steel;  JF - New Markets and  Investments; AS - New Markets and Bus Dev. During that meeting, we need to  have some real players with i2 there to brainstorm and discuss business  expansion opportunities in the specific verticals. It would be good to  actually have this meeting in Dallas but I am concerned about attendance. i2  owns the process and supply/downstream management in these industries and we  need to really look to see if our combination can accelerate our new efforts  and solve any logistic issues. Put together an action plan. George's group has already put a presentation  together about i2, the products and possible applications. George, please  sent that to John. I would like that document to be our updated business  plan for i2 to be used as a ""living"" document as we move forward. Assign someone to make and co-ordinate the use and full deployment of those  products (utilize our $10 million spend). I want someone to have the  responsibility for i2 and he or she can also work with EBS on what they are  doing also. To be clear, we have spent the $10 million already but are not  using the products. I want to deploy all (if possible) and make this  investment fully utilized. I do understand that we don't drive businesses  around a pre-purchased product but we should look at is as a sunk cost and  rationalize why we shouldn't use if rather that simply considering it as an  option. Jason Robert, (469) 357-6737, was at the dinner with Sanjiv, Greg Brady, Jeff  and Greg and he knows some of the mutual objectives. He would be the guy to  work with and set it all up.

Is there an application for all of EES and their business? Remember, Ken Lay is considering joining their board and we should be able to  give him very clear insight on their products and how their company works.

Back in the  day, they would have been looking for actual pipeline scheduling experience,  but anymore, the liquidity for gas schedulers is so low, that they will  consider most people, with an analytical or coordinative type background.

Just be aware, that if you were to become a gas scheduler, it may require  working on weekends, and late nights from time to time. As far as the next step, I would suggest that you just simply send an e-mail  to George Smith, Manager of Logistics on the Central Desk, and ask him if he  has time to visit with you. I think that by simply expressing an interest,  and learning what his expectations are of a scheduler, and also, learning  what you can expect to learn from him, should serve as the first step. Also, if he is interested, and does not have a position currently open, then  he will pass on your name to some of the other managers. They're actually  pretty good about that!

The weighted average trade price via Enron Online will reflect a price of  $15.76, but coupled with the volume not transacted online, this price was  estimated to be a $16.00 midpoint.

As a result,  volumes were traded for the December 22-26 time period. Gas Daily published  a price of $15.70 for the December 22-26 time period. Nicor Gas Company made  a decision to buy gas on December 22nd for the December 23-26 time period. I  received several phone calls from various marketing companies expressing  concern that Gas Daily was going to revise the posting, based on the minimal  activity that transacted on December 22nd. While, my practice is to simply take the price as reported on Enron Online,  from time-to-time, the there will be significant volumes transacted over the  telephone that will impact the Enron Online price.

What really sucks is that we just gave this game away with the punting team. I am trying not to get too down about this. This is  a young team that is  going to make mental errors and they will improve. I still thinks we will  have a good season. The only freshman I saw getting any PT was Cory Redding. He looks fast out  there and really crushed somebody on a kick off return. He also got some  snaps at DE on a couple of 3 and longs, but didn't do anything outstanding. Unfortunately he was also out there on the punt team during the debacles. Victor Ike should be our starting tailback. He look big and fast and gets  yardages running in the interior. Ike left a defender looking really stupid  on his long TD run. Sweet moves. Hodges look about like he did last year. Had a couple of good runs but doesn't seem to use his blocking very well. OK, so we will begin our win streak with Stanford. The thing I really like  was that Mack said he takes full responsibility for the punting problems and  that he will insure that they get fixed. Mackovic would have made excuses  that essentially put the blame elsewhere. This season could be an up and  down one, but the real prize is next year and the years after.

Enron will only provide a payment guaranty. Enron does not have the means to  ensure performance by the LLC. Thus the language needs to clearly identify  that this is a payment guaranty. As long as Transco gets paid for the  transport, I am not sure why this matters. 2. Transco would be able to collect interest for late payments under their  tariff. Putting late payment interest in the guaranty would give Transco the  ability to recover double interest on late payments. Thus, the interest  language in the guaranty was removed. Please review the revised guaranty. I would be happy to discuss these issues  with Transco's attorney's at their convenience. Let me know if you have any  questions. Thanks.",Transco Guaranty,nemec-g

All we are doing here is effecting  the provisions of the Purchase Agreement to which both parties have already  agreed. 3. The added sentence at the end of the second paragraph - This needs to be  stricken. The Medicine Bow System is not ENA's and we do not want to create  a firm purchase deal with this letter. 4. 1st Sentence of Third Paragraph - The add from ""that quantity of Gas.....  to..........

The Cove Point LNG, Limited Partnership and Egan Hub Partners,  L.P. are both FERC regulated entities and both agreements have negotiated  rates. The Cove Point deal has a negotiated reservation charge and the Egan Hub  Partners has a negotiated storage reservation and injection charge. Since we  are buying the assets of Columbia and assigning the contracts to Enron and   these deals are at less than max rates, they would be subject to reposting  upon assignment and there would be no guarantee that Enron would receive  these rates in a competetive bidding situation. It is my understanding the  discounts were taken into account for valuation purposes, however these  discounts are at risk due to posting requirements. The remainder of the storage contracts would require consents to assign. Note: Any transport contracts with discounted rates would be subject to the  same as above.

3930,_44.subject,"Steve,  We are currently negotiating an interconnect agreement for an upgrade  of an existing interconnect off the Trawick System into TUFCO. The  interconnect is solely a delivery to TUFCO. We are down to one point of  difference in the agreement. Typically HPL disclaims any liability for consequential damages to the other  party. TUFCO is asking for an exception for any violation of gas quality  specifications. This would mean that if HPL delivered off spec gas to TUFCO  which required cleanup of their pipeline system or caused damage to a  customer of TUFCO's HPL would be liable under this Agreement. From a legal standpoint, we can make this exception, but I wanted to make  sure everyone understood and agreed with the acceptance of this potential  liability.

3934,_459.subject,"Heather,    I talked further with Transwestern Counsel today concerning the issues and  have the following points;   1. FERC was made aware of the Compression Services arrangement with ECS in  the filings for the certification of the Kachina units. FERC simply didn't  ask any further questions in that proceeding. The Operation & Maintenance  Agreements in place for the Kachina units essentially accomplishes the same  tasks as the Operational Control Agreement in Gallup. TW feels the O&M  agreements would be adequate to address any concerns about TW's regulatory  responsibility over the compressor facilities. The Operational Control  agreement was put into place in the Gallup Transaction because it was thought  to be easier to give FERC exactly what is was looking for rather than provide  them with the Gallup O&M Agreement which might unecessarily complicate the  certification process at that time. 2. There is no basis in FERC Regs or the NGA for FERC to impose any type of  penalty or discontinue the Compression Service due to TW's operation of  Kachina without the Operational Control Agreement. No regs or law address  this situation. Again this is tempered by the fact that FERC was made aware  of the arrangement and didn't ask any questions and the O&M agreement is in  place to accomplish control for TW. 3. I also faxed you a copy of Section 19(c) of the NGA which indicates that  the petition for rehearing does not effect the status of the certificate. Construction is moving ahead and the targeted start date is May 1. I will forward the filing TW made wrt to the Operational Control Agreement as  soon as I recieve it.

3990,_657.subject,"Dan,  I have reviewed the Wildhorse (Mesa) Gathering, Processing, and  Transport Agreement. This agreement is still valid and the gas is dedicated  to this Agreement through 2013. The agreement present some problematic  issues which I will outline. 1. Gas Quality -  The gas quality provisions only require Wildhorse to  transport the gas if the gas meets the downstream carriers (in this case  Northwest Pipeline) gas quality specifications. We propose to put in a  treating plant which would allow the gas to meet the specifications, however  there are no provision in this Agreement which allow us to insert a plant  between Northwest Pipeline and Wildhorse. Wildhorse could delay are extract  value from us for this connection. This is an uncertainty. 2. Wildhorse Obligation to Perform - Based on my understanding of the  facts, at some point during the term of this agreement, Northwest Pipeline  enforced their gas quality specifications and refused to take the gas at the  downstream side of Wildhorse's Gathering System. As a result, Wildhorse shut  in Enogex's production and it has been shut in ever since. Wildhorse has a  right to do this under this Agreement (see #1 above) and therefore Wildhorse  has not breached its obligation to transport under this Agreement. Wildhorse's obligation was suspended when Northwest refused receipt of the  gas. 3. Unprofitability - Assuming Wildhorse worked with us to install the  treating plant which conformed the gas to Northwest Specifications, they  could refuse to provide gathering service under this agreement if it was  still uneconomical for them to do so. If they decided it is uneconomical for  them to do so, they have the right to provide Enogex with various potential  solutions which include (i) renegotiating the terms (ii) allowing Enogex to  operate Wildhorse's equipment at Enogex sole cost, expense and risk, or (iii)  release the gas from the Agreement. The problem here is that there is no  time limit under which Wildhorse must reach a solution with us and no  specific solution they must reach. Wildhorse could drag this out for some  extended period of time and they could extract significant value. My  recommendation is that we make Enogex's resolution of these issues with  Wildhorse a condition precedent to closing and funding this deal. I know the  timing is late. However if Enron funds this deal and takes on the risk of  negotiating with Wildhorse to resolve either a new deal or a release of the  gas,  everyone needs to understand that such negotiation could take  substantial time and Wildhorse will have significant leverage. Let me know if you wish to discuss this further or have any questions.",Wildhorse Gathering Agreement,nemec-g

3998,_692.subject,"Confidential Work Material - Attorney Client Privilege   Attached for review is a draft of the letter to be sent to Wildhorse  concerning the Gathering Agreement under which the Entrada and Dakota  production is committed. Please review and provide comments. To summarize activities to date concerning this Gathering Agreement:  1. Conducted a conference call with Brett Frie on Wednesday. Brett also  forwarded some correspondence between Enogex and Wildhorse. The  correspondence contained a summary of meeting minutes for two meetings  conducted between Enogex and Wildhorse. No demands were made by Enogex and  no claims of unprofitability were made by Wildhorse. Brett stated that the  Entrada and to some extent the Dakota gas were shut in or curtailed because  the downstream carriers starting enforcing their tighter gas specifications. Enogex took Wildhorse's word for that and never checked with Northwest or  Questar. I asked Brett why he thought Wildhorse would straight away release  the gas. He responded that he thought they would do so only if Crescendo  negotiated an alternative arrangement with Wildhorse. 2. I received more correspondence on Friday from Ken Krisa. Nothing really  useful. There was a letter from Wildhorse to another producer in the area  called Lone Mountain Production Company which stated that Wildhorse thought  these assets were in a state of economic viability decline. Unfortunately  this letter was not directed to Enogex. However, the draft letter takes that  position with Wildhorse. 3. I am securing local consul out of Denver. I want someone intimately  familiar with Utah and Colorado law from a litigation and timing perspective  to be involved. We may need to seek a declaratory order. We have run into  to conflicts with law firm that have represented either KN or Tom Brown. Should have this resolved on Monday. 4. Agreed to language on Friday with Ken Krisa and Jim Osborne and the  declaration by Crescendo giving power to ENA to negotiate with Wildhorse. This draft does state our desire to pursue a release of the gas. However, to  reiterate, based on the current facts we do not have a black and white right  to deem this gas as released under the Gathering Agreement. The fact that  the Entrada Gas is not in spec. with the downstream pipelines for inerts,  allows Wildhorse to suspend their receipt of this gas without being in  default.",Wildhorse Letter,nemec-g

If Ben elects to continue  to use Scott's services beyond Q1 2001, a value sharing agreement between  Ben, Calger and myself will have to be agreed upon. Jeff Ader will make a decision (after consultation with me) as to Scott's  continued involvement on the fuel cell tax monetization and Dighton  restructuring project. If Jeff makes the decision that Scott needs to  remain actively involved in order to close the transaction, a value sharing  agreement will be made between Jeff, Calger, and myself. The value  allocation % will be agreed upon upfront within the next week. If a fair  value sharing agreement cannot be reached, Jeff will transition  responsibility to another member of his origination team.

The crowd was soooo wild...that is until we  won. And I got to see Cathy Freeman and Marion Jones run. The whole first  week of my trip was spent at the olympics everyday. And the second week I  spent touring all the beaches that I could find. Oh, here's a funny story  for you. Okay I'm halfway across the world in a country known for bronze,  muscular sufers, right? So I take a day cruise around the Brisbane waters  one day. These cruises are scheduled everyday and each ship holds about  80-100 people. As we board the captain tells us that there will be 85 people  on the cruise. Here's the fun part....80 of the 85 people were from a WWII  veterans reunion!!! I was on a boat full of grandpa's. Actually it was  pretty funny. This one old man sat next to me and started telling me why  they were having the reunion and what thier batallion had done during the  war. Then he tells me (keep in mind this man's at least 70) that he was a  lifesaver (lifeguard) on one of the local beaches until the year before when  an injury forced him to retire!!! Then he starts telling me about the war. He said, ""Yeah, I was a POW for about 9 days but they weren't feeding me very  well so I left."" He had escaped from a Nazi POW camp and fled to Greece  where he joined the Greek reserve forces. Because he fought with Greece in  the war he's now a Greek citizen. Then after the war he and some friends  bought a van and traveled all over Europe and Asia. When they ran out of  money they'd just stop and get jobs until they could save some money and then  they'd start again. I hope one day I have stories even half that  interesting!!

4337,_122.subject,"Stamos,  I don't think many buying opportunities out there. The economy is going to  get  crushed this year. There's only one place to put one's money now, and that  is in cash. The manufacturing sector is in dire straits and you will continue to see an  increase in plant shutdowns and company layoffs. The Fed could continue to lower rates  but there'll be little capital investment if consumer spending dries up. I feel we've  just seen the beginning. I think the Dow will be trading under 8000 by the end of April. Psychologically, the California crisis will add to consumer fear. The crisis  is not a short term problem. As a result, barring any Federal bailout, you could kiss that  state's economy goodbye. Let me ask you a question; if you were paying (1) the highest real estate  prices in the country, and  (2) the highest energy prices for the least reliable power, in (3) the midst  of a hi-tech meltdown, what would keep you or your company from closing shop and moving to a different state?? If you own any CA real estate, sell. The only way to solve the CA energy crisis is to  reduce demand or increase supply. Since CA doesn't want any power plants in its backyard, the supply issue  likely won't be solved anytime soon. So, how do impact demand?? You have to price energy(power/gas) so  high that the discretionary user (household, manufacturer, commercial store) conserves  by closing its plant, cutting back on the thermastat or running the commercial operation during off-peak  hours. California will see this reduction in demand over time. If the blackouts subside it's because so  many businesses have closed their doors for good or moved to another state. Without this, the  blackouts will get much worse. If the state tries to get into the business of buying and selling electricity  and gas, I would bet it will go bankrupt within 2-3 yrs. Could you imagine the impact on the national  economy from the bankruptcy  of the U.S.'s most prosperous state.

4349,_1047.subject,"Attorney-Client Privileged Communication Not Discoverable    Hi Tim  Leslie Reeves recently spoke to me about an outstanding receivable we still  have relating to PCA. PCA went into bankruptcy in 1998. At the time of PCA's bankruptcy, PCA owed   a $5.3 million receivable to EPMI. On EPMI's books, this uncollected  receivable amount was offset by an out-of-the money forward position EPMI had  with PCA which we were able to take to zero when PCA defaulted (contract  provided for one  way payments upon the occurrence of an event of default)  and some funds from credit. After netting all these amounts,  there is still  a $600,000 receivable showing up as owed from PCA to EPMI. Based on the  current bankruptcy proceedings, it is not likely that EPMI will receive any  additional funds from PCA (we have taken a very low key approach in the  bankruptcy due to the lack of PCA funds, the extensive amounts owed by PCA to  other creditors, the assertions being made by PCA against some of the other  creditors, and the legal effect of the one-way payment termination payment  that provided us a significant offset to the receivable). Accordingly, unless I hear otherwise from you, I will talk to Leslie and tell  her to go ahead and clean up the $600,000  PCA receivable now, and in the  unlikely event PCA makes payments to any creditors,  we would then give such  amounts received from PCA back to you.

I want to add language to our physical contracts that addresses material  changes/disappearance of the published prices that would mirror the financial  trading terms and doubt whether we would want to make the imposition of a cap  on power prices a MDE. If you treat the imposition of a cap (say in CA of  prices to $500 or in NEPOOL to $1,000) as a MDE, then we would be required to  secure quotes as to what the price would have been without the cap each time  that a pricing date trades at the cap level. This only seems fraught with  litigation risk to me. Alternatively, if caps are not deemed a MDE, then you  would always settle against the published prices, even if they are  ""artificially"" determined after the trade was entered into. While caps are  not appealing, I think it would be better to not have the imposition of caps  be considered a MDE. I have spoken with the financial trading group and they  will follow our lead on this. So, depending upon what you both think, we  will make sure that financial and physical power are treated the same on this  issue. Thanks for your thoughts.",Index Transactions,sager-e
4373,_40.subject,"CONFIDENTIAL ATTORNEY/CLIENT INFORMATION NOT DISCOVERABLE  Two years after PCA's bankruptcy, we received a demand letter from PCA. PCA  claims that EPMI owes PCA $15,126,445.16 for damages resulting from EPMI's  wrongful termination of transactions in June 1998. This amount appears to be  based on PCA's calculation of the forward values of the terminated trades,  and certain ""preference payments"" that PCA claims were made to EPMI. This  claim is in its preliminary stages. I will update you with further  information as soon as we get a handle on what the Trustee is really  seeking. As you will remember, we currently have a proof of claim pending  against PCA for over $5 million dollars representing our unpaid receivable  amount. Bill  In connection with this matter, it would be very helpful if you could have  someone gather the following information:  1. Date and amount of last payment made by PCA, splitting the relative net  amounts owed to and from EPMI (I would assume that payment for April  deliveries was made - accordingly, I would assume that the last payment we  received from PCA would have been around May 20th). 2. Total amount of MWH delivered to PCA but for which PCA never paid for. 3. The details of how you calculated the net MTM exposure of the terminated  transactions (pursuant to an email to me dated July 27, 1998 you had  calculated the MTM as of July 7, 1998 at $3,772,939)  As always, thanks for your help.",PCA Demand Letter,sager-e

4400,_759.subject,"Last week, the WSPP drafing group met in sunny California  to continue the  slow and steady march towards a standardized, ""national"" agreement. Schedule  C , the service schedule for firm transactions, was the primary topic and the  following is a summary of where the group is headed. After much discussion, we proposed  that the group consider the definition of  firm energy  that Tim, Christian and others have been considering. The  following is proposed language (the base was EPMI's version) that the WSPP  group is currently reviewing:  Firm Power is power that is sold and scheduled in accordance with applicable  reserve requirements for which the only excuse for the failure to deliver or  recieve are those set forth in Schedule 3.9 of the WSPP Agreement. Seller  shall take steps necessary for the power to be considered Firm Power under  this definition. Schedule 3.9 only allows interruption if (i) within agreed recall time, (ii)  due to an Uncontrollable Force or (iii) power is need for native load;  provided, however it was agreed that a party would neverless be liable for  LDs if it interrupts due to native load requirements (this last point is a  major accomplishment that apppears to have uniform agreement and will be  implemented in the next draft - the group claimed that the ""optics"" are  necessary to help traditional utilities). As a further note, the group  agreed to do away with all references to C1 and  C2 and have just one  Schedule. Changes from EPMI's proposed definition where  the result of the following  discussions:  1. Generated vs. Sold - ""Sold"" was elected over ""generated"" because the  group thinks that it is the receiving control area that determines the  generator's reserve requirements. 2. ""Schedule""  was added to bolster the scheduling requirements. 3. ""Reserves"" instead of ""Operating Reserves"" was used because the group  thought the word operating may be too restrictive. 4. ""WSCC reserve requirements"" was replaced with ""applicable"" reserve  requirements because the group thinks that the WSPP Agreement is national in  scope and should not be limited to WSPP. 5. References to Non-firm supply as being excluded from Firm Power was  excluded because the group thought it was redundent  - no control area would  accept a non-firm supply as being firm. 6. Power rather than energy is being used only bacause that is the decision  that has already been made. This defintion will be further discussed at  the next meeting on Aug 20th in  Denver. Prior to that time, I would like to get your thoughts on how this is  shaping up and what additions/deletions are appropriate. I look forward to  hearing your thoughts.

All of you should have  received a black binder labelled ""Analysis of ECT's Finacial, Power, Gas  Forms""  which contains all of the long and short forms used for trading (as  such forms existed in January 1999), as well as my summary comparison as to  how each of the forms handles certain legal issues (eg, termination, cover,  assignement, confidentiality ....). If you did not receive or cannot locate  this binder, let me know and I will forward to you another copy. This  analysis was done in January. I am aware that some of the forms may have  changed since then but have not undertaken to ""update"" the memo as we will be  able to discuss such changes at the meeting. The purpose of the meeting is to review how each of the Houston-based  trading  forms has been structured and to note where there are differences. The ultimate goal is to determine what Enron's ""model"" trading provisions  should be and to determine a consistent approach unless there is a justified  rational for treating the commodities in a different manner. With this in  mind, I would hope to be able to create a ""modular type"" contract  whereby  each legal issue would have a recommended approach, evidenced by language  that will be approved by the group. By way of example, Enron's gas contract  prohibits assignement without consent, which consent can be withheld for any  reason. The financial form provides that a party can not unreasonably  withhold its consent. At this meeting we would discuss what the preferred  approach is and then begin the process of drafting appropriate language,  which language would be approved at a seperate meeting. This  ""modular  assignment section"" could then be dropped into all trading forms unless  differences were required due to the commodity/product involved. You will note that the analysis performed to date does not include all areas  of a trading contract. Similiar steps will still need to be undertaken with  other provisions such as credit terms. At the meeting, I hope to further  discuss the additional areas everybody believes should be reviewed.

The legal issue is one straight out of first year  Contracts class: Was there a meeting of the minds so as to create a binding  contract? When I first looked at this I was somewhat concerned. In response  to an email from Duke describing a particular index pricing, Julian responded  simply ""I agree."" But after talking to Don, Greg Whalley ,reviewing all the  email correspondence, and, most importantly, listening to the trader tapes, I  am convinced that Julian never agreed to the index that Duke is alleging. In  other words I think we can make a good argument to get around  the damaging ""  I agree"" email. It is clear that Duke's trader didn't, and probably still  doesn't understand what index she was usingin her email. The Master Agreement  provides for arbitration in Houston with three arbitrators, one of whom must  have 8 years of experience in derivatives. I'll take my chances with that  kind of panel.

The reason  is simple:  the market has moved and they failed to act quickly. 3. All markets,pet coke markets in particular, are time sensitive. Because  Votorantim has delayed in the execution of final   documents, it accepted the  risk that, over time, market prices would change and Enron would no longer be  willing to sign a deal. 4. Again, we never had a final, enforceable deal. Their only claim is that we  misrepresented to them our willingness to do the deal and therefor they  didn't pursue negotiations with a third party.

If Steve Harris is OK with the idea of doing a deal that requires filing, I  will draft something and send it your way. * * * The referenced negotiated transaction provides for a transportation service  under DMP's Rate Schedule FTS. Rather than paying a reservation charge, the negotiated agreement  specifies that KGS will pay a volumetric rate. The volumetric rate will equal DMP's maximum interruptible  transportation service rate as set forth in DMP's tariff. . .The contract also (a) specifies five Dth/d as  KGS' maximum daily reservation  quantity, (b) lists KGS' primary receipt as Meter # 9999999 and (c)  identifies five primary delivery points for  KGS. . . Upon filing Docket No. RP99-240-000, DMP stated that it agreed to  the above negotiated rate so  that KGS could serve small residential customers on DMP's system under a firm  rate schedule.",TW/Red Cedar deal,scott-s

4491,_146.subject,"You asked whether current contract approval procedures require the marketers  to get Legal's approval on all transportation contracts. The answer is no. If you look at the ET&S policy on authority to grant transportation and  storage discounts (I can fax it to you if you don' t have it), there is a  column for ""Pre-approved Terms"" and one for ""Non Pre-Approved Terms"". Contracts that are not on a pre-approved form always have to have the Legal  Dept's approval. Contracts on pre-approved forms with a total discount (for  the entire contract term) of less than $1.2 million do not need Legal's  approval; those above the threshold do. Does that make sense? As far as I  know our marketers have been following this. I spoke with TK and she is  aware of the policy, and she is also aware that she needs to show me any  contract that deviates from our standard language.

4492,_147.subject,"Drew, I wanted you to be aware of a potential dispute with regard to our  consultant, Mark Baldwin of IGS. Our consulting agreement with IGS (which  has now terminated) provided for a flat fee, plus an incentive fee calculated  using the net present value of any contract ""identified by IGS"" and entered  into during the term of the consulting agreement. During the term of the  agreement, TW entered into its Gallup Expansion agreement with Southern. IGS  is now claiming it brought in the deal and so is entitled to an incentive  fee. While it is undisputed that Mark discussed the deal with Southern,  Southern was also on Lorraine's list of shippers to contact for Gallup  Expansion capacity. Also, the capacity was posted for all to see. So, while  Mark can certainly claim he ""identified"" the deal, he was not alone in doing  so. Steve is going to call Mark in response to his letter (after he talks to  Lorraine to verify facts). Our thinking is that if we offer IGS some money  they will be happy. We would really like to preserve what has been a good  working relationship with this consultant. On the other hand, I think we  could probably take the position that they are not entitled to any incentive  fee. However, since the contract is silent as to whether IGS has to be the  only party bringing in the deal in order to qualify for the incentive fee,  this position is not as strong as I'd like it to be, and IGS might sue TW. The amount in dispute could be as much as $200,000, depending on what rate we  use in calculating net present value. If you have any problem with our offering to pay part of the incentive fee to  IGS, let me know. I think it will be very important for Steve not to admit  that Mark helped in any way in getting the deal -- just in case they do",contract issue,scott-s

4495,_154.subject,"Here is the quick & dirty. None of the Gallup contracts contain a shipper out if the facilities are not  placed in service by a certain date. The respective obligations of the  parties do not commence until the facilities are ""tested and placed in  service."" We notified our shippers by telephone yesterday that the  facilities were in service. The compressor has since been taken down because  of excessive vibration and an unusual whining noise of undetermined origin. EE&CC does not know how long it will take to correct the problems; they do  not have enough information yet to even give an estimate. Based on our  experience with Hubbard, it could take months to correct the problem. Today,  we've been able to deliver all nominated gas simply because noms did not  exceed our existing capacity. Nominations are expected to exceed existing  capacity this week, in which case we will have to allocate. Given the uncertainty involved, from a PR standpoint I believe it would be  best to tell the customers that because of unforeseen circumstances we are  not in service after all, that we apologize for the mistake and will do our  best to provide service on a daily or interruptible basis. When the  compressor is actually tested and really in service, we'll let them know. The downside:  we get no reservation charge at all. (estimated loss:   $25,000/month) The upside:  in the long run we probably save face with our customers. From a short-term economic standpoint, the better choice appears to be not to  revoke our ""in-service"" announcement. When summer weather kicks in, we'll  probably have to allocate every day. On our EBB we will have to give some  reason for the allocation (or if we don't, shippers will demand an  explanation anyway). Shippers' rights to a reservation refund will be  triggered. The downside:  shippers will never trust us again. Also, we could be subject  to fraud or related causes of action for representing the compressor was ""in  service"" when we knew it was not. The upside:  on the off chance no one files a lawsuit and wins, we might at  least get to keep some of the reservation charges owed us, to the extent  deliveries don't fall below 75% of nominated quantities for a period of  longer than 75 days in months other than July and August this summer. (In  July and August, we don't get any reservation charge for amounts not  delivered). We just need to keep in mind that normally the pipeline runs  full in the summer months, and Gallup capacity was sold with that assumption  in mind. Haven't had time to do a formal write-up; if you want me to turn this into a  memo for wider distribution, let me know. For now, I think it's important to  get a decision on one of the above options.

One change that has been called for is that if a Limited Day is called  (for now let's say a total Limited Day, without notifying shippers of any  percentages), no LFT can flow at any time during that day but the LFT shipper  would have the option to flow IT to the extent space is available. If a  Limited Day were called notifying shippers that only a certain percentage  would flow, LFT shippers would be able to flow that percentage, and the rest  could be scheduled IT. Drew latched onto this when I mentioned it to him and wanted to debate this  change with me. As currently configured, TW's system would allow LFT  shippers to put in nominations on a Limited Day, and if any LFT capacity were  in fact available that LFT would be scheduled. Similarly, if TW were to  notify shippers of a partial Limited Day (say 50%), and 60% of the capacity  in fact became available, TW's system (today) would allow LFT shippers to put  their nominations in and flow 60%, not limit them to 50%.

4526,_281.subject,"Lorraine, here are a few notes from my review of the Val Verde contract, and  my initial impressions. Let's talk more about how to approach the issue  after we meet with Ron tomorrow about MAOP. 12/31/92 Interconnect Agreement:  Sec. 1.3 specifies pressures and states that unless there is an agreement to  provide firm compression service TW will accept up to 200,000 on an  interruptible basis. Sec. 2 states that the Blanco Hub MAOP shall not be exceeded. Sec. 4.2 limits damages (no consequential damages). The contract also has a fairly standard force majeure clause. 2/18/93 letter amendment:  Sec. 3 obligates TW to provide firm compression service in order to accept  200,000 into TW's system (provided MOGI has pressure of at least 650 and  quantity of at least 140). Acknowledges that this is an agreement to provide  firm compression in accordance with Sec. 1.3 of 12/92 agreement. 9/25/95 letter amendment:  Increases quantity to be received at the interconnect to 250,000 once the San  Juan expansion is effective. My initial conclusions:  It is pretty clear we have an obligation to accept  250,000 on a firm basis, provided that Burlington complies with the pressure  requirements. Probably the only way we can avoid this obligation is if  accepting 250,000 would cause us to exceed the hub MAOP. In that case we can  argue impossibility of performance. Also, we could avoid the obligation  because the summer heat above certain temperatures constitutes force  majeure. This argument is strengthened by the fact that temperatures seem to  have gotten hotter over the years. The fact that we entered into our most recent agreement with Burlington in  January of this year weakens the credibility of our arguments (they will say  we should have known by now). Burlington might try to argue that we have an  absolute obligation to comply with the agreement, even if it means expensive  system modifications. That argument is not a very strong one because the  agreement contains no such affirmative obligation and in fact quite clearly  describes the facilities that are the subject of the agreement.",Burlington: PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL ATTORNEY-CLIENT  COMMUNICATION,scott-s

4528,_283.subject,"Attached is the latest draft of the Transport Option Program filing. There are a couple of important changes from the last draft. One is that we're no longer stating that the option fee is going to be  ""market-based."" At FERC, the term ""market-based"" has connotations of having  to prove to FERC that a non-cost-based rate is appropriate because we lack  market power. While we probably do lack market power, the consensus of the  legal/regulatory team was to try to portray the option fee as a built-in  feature of the transport rate, which is simply being disaggregated into a  separate option fee. If this theory is not clear to you after you read the  filing letter, let's discuss how it should be improved. The other significant change (also based on my meeting with legal/regulatory)  is that I've structured the tariff language and the agreement so that every  shipper, regardless of whether they currently use transport on TW, will have  to have a firm transportation agreement when they buy an option. In other  words, a shipper that does not currently have a service agreement will simply  execute an agreement with a MAXDTQ of zero. This structure has two  advantages:  1) it's consistent with our option-fee-as-part-of-transport-rate  theory, and 2) it will help support that theory in our next rate case. I'd like to meet next week, either Wednesday afternoon or Thursday, to  discuss the following topics:  1)  Your comments and questions on this draft, 2)  Some examples of options, to make sure the tariff provisions and contract  work from a logistical standpoint, 3)  The bidding process, and how bids for options will be evaluated, and 4)  Comments received from shippers thus far.

4529,_285.subject,"Attached is the latest draft of the Transport Option Program filing. After  our discussion last week I made a couple of significant changes from the last  draft. One is that we're no longer stating that the option fee is going to be  ""market-based."" Instead I have tried to portray the option fee as a  built-in feature of the transport rate, which is simply being disaggregated  into a separate option fee. The other significant change is that I've structured the tariff language and  the agreement so that every shipper, regardless of whether they currently use  transport on TW, will have to have a firm transportation agreement when they  buy an option. In other words, a shipper that does not currently have a  service agreement will simply execute an agreement with a MAXDTQ of zero. If  you don't think I've explained this clearly enough, let me know. I'm meeting informally with the Commercial Group next week to discuss 1) some  examples of options to make sure the tariff provisions and contract work from  a logistical standpoint, 2) the bidding process, and how bids for options  will be evaluated, and 3) further comments received from shippers. I'll  circulate our ideas on bidding and awarding options, and any other new ideas  or questions. As I've discussed with some of you, our shippers are asking to see the filing  in its entirety before we file it, and would like to have a roundtable  meeting prior to filing to discuss their concerns. I realize there is some  concern about showing them our filing. What if we just show them our final  tariff language and form agreement, and offer to host a meeting to discuss  their questions? Let me know what you think. Our target filing date will depend on whether we have a customer meeting  first, and when FERC staff is available to talk.",Transport Options on TW,scott-s
4530,_286.subject,"Yesterday Jeff Fawcett, Lee Ferrell and I met with Dynegy marketing and  legal/regulatory representatives regarding TW Transport Options. Overall the  meeting was very positive. We had nothing but encouraging remarks from the  marketing representatives. However, the regulatory people (Sarah Tomalty, Ed  Ross) had a couple of issues. The biggest issue is a marketing affiliate  concern. Apparently Dynegy is on a crusade at FERC to place further limits  on deals pipelines can do with their marketing affiliates. They have run  into situations in which pipelines (examples:  Koch, El Paso) have blatantly  favored their marketing affiliates to the extent that Dynegy cannot even do  deals with them. (In fact, one of the problems with Koch has been Koch's  price option deals with its affiliate.) The perception is that the  affiliates, by using ""funny money,"" can always make themselves the highest  bidder, with a net benefit to the entire organization (pipeline +  affiliate). The remedy Dynegy is proposing is to require a marketing  affiliate, if it is the highest bidder, to credit back the difference between  the price it pays and the price offered by the next highest bidder. The  presumption is that the affiliate has an unfair advantage because it is able  to pay above market value in order to get the capacity. Dynegy's proposal  would encourage affiliates to pay ""real"" dollars. While it emphasized its belief that TW does not favor its marketing  affiliates, Dynegy would like for us to include in our filing some limitation  on options transactions with marketing affiliates. It is likely that other  pipelines will file for the ability to sell options once FERC approves our  filing, and Dynegy would like for this type of protection to be part of the  precedent set by our filing. Ed hinted that FERC may be considering a  divestiture requirement for marketing affiliates, and that pipelines can  avoid this extreme result by voluntarily limiting their transactions with  affiliates. Shelley, I know you've discussed this issue with Ed already and  our reactions were the same. Basically we politely told Dynegy that we don't  believe we're part of the problem and that we are therefore not inclined to  unnecessarily disadvantage our company by further limiting ENA's ability to  do business with TW. We can probably expect an intervention with comments  or a limited protest addressing the issue. The other regulatory question was whether we intend to file each option deal  as a negotiated rate. My analysis of this issue is that since we're  proposing the option fee as part of the transport rate, options would always  be a type of negotiated rate and would need to be filed. If you think this  is not the right answer, please let me know because we need to decide it  before we file the tariff sheets. Sarah's question seemed to be more one of  curiosity rather than a basis for protest. Like the Indicated Shippers, Dynegy appeared interested in an all-customer  meeting to discuss the service. Jeff and the rest of the commercial group  are looking further into whether and when we would have such a meeting. If you have any questions or concerns please let me know.",TW Options Update: Dynegy meeting,scott-s
4531,_287.subject,"I've looked into whether we can terminate our Val Verde interconnect  agreement with Burlington, and have determined we may do so only if we take  the following steps:  1. Terminate the OBA by giving 30 days notice to Burlington.

4538,_301.subject,"Transwestern held its Transport Options Workshop on August 31. Commercial  and regulatory representatives of BP-Amoco, Burlington, Conoco, Coral,  Dynegy, Phillips and Reliant attended. After a brief overview of the  proposed filing, TW opened the floor for questions and comments. Here is a  summary of the comments. Marketing affiliate concerns. BP's regulatory representative expressed  concern that TW's marketing affiliates would be able to use options to game  the system. In BP's example, since TW and ENA are both Enron companies, ENA  could purchase an ""out of the money"" call option essentially cost free, since  its affiliate (TW) would have the ability to buy the option back. Proceeds  from ENA's ability to then ""move the market"" through the establishment of the  long basis position would go directly to Enron's bottom line. BP suggested  that TW's marketing affiliates be banned from purchasing options, or that the  marketing affiliate be required to credit 100% of the option proceeds to  other shippers. Although BP admits that Transwestern's prior dealings with  ENA have not been suspect, BP fears that TW's filing will set a precedent for  other pipelines to offer a similar service. Since TW will be the first  pipeline to offer such services, BP wants TW's program to be as restricted as  possible. Dynegy echoed BP's concern regarding possible affiliate abuse, but  rather than shelve the program entirely, Dynegy reiterated an earlier  suggestion that Transwestern be required to credit back the difference  between the option fee paid by an affiliate and the next highest bidder, if  the affiliate's bid exceeds the next highest by a certain percentage. TW's response was that while actual abuse of an options program by a  marketing affiliate may be a legitimate concern, owing to its unassailable  record in this area, TW should be entitled to a presumption that it has  complied and will continue to comply with Commission policy covering the sale  of capacity to marketing affiliates, and was not inclined to voluntarily  include any limitations on the options program. If BP and others have  serious concerns regarding the Commission's overall policy on marketing  affiliates, those issues should be raised in a separate proceeding that  applies to all interstate pipelines. Right of first refusal. Burlington asked whether options would replace the  right of first refusal. TW's  response was that ROFR will still be available  pursuant to the terms and conditions of our tariff. Negotiated rate. BP's representative claimed that option contracts will  constitute a negotiated rate and that each deal will need to be filed as  such. TW did not respond to this or discuss it further. However, TW's  position at this point is that since the option fee is part of the  transportation rate, transportation deals that include the option amendment  will only be considered negotiated rate deals if the total rate including the  option fee exceeds the maximum transport rate. Hoarding capacity. Using the recent large block sale of capacity on El Paso  as an example, several customers expressed concern that the options program  would make it easier for a shipper to hoard capacity. It was not clear why  some of the workshop participants thought that the sale of options would  create more opportunity for hoarding capacity than already exists. Perhaps  because the option fee is a lesser cost than the transport rate for the  underlying capacity, their perception was that options would simply make  hoarding cheaper and easier. TW acknowledged that the potential for  withholding capacity from the market is one reason for FERC's current policy  against reserving capacity for shippers. Although TW did not commit to  placing any limits on the either the quantity of capacity or options for  capacity that any one shipper may own, it is possible that FERC may require  TW to do so in a final order. Our plan is to meet with PG&E and SoCalGas in California the week of  September 11 to go over details of the program, and to finalize the FERC  filing by mid-September.",TW Options update,scott-s

Can a new shipper who enters into an FTS-1 contract with zero MDQ in order  to purchase a shipper call option or sell a transporter put option be  allowed, prior to the exercise date, to transfer the underlying option rights  by permanently releasing this contract? YES. ? Will we be required to report these contracts with zero MDQ on the Index  of Customers and/or the Transactional Report? YES. ? Can the releasing shipper permanently release a portion of his existing MDQ  and choose to keep or transfer the option rights? YES. The shipper could  even release all of its MDQ (reducing it to zero) and keep its option rights. ? How is it determined whether a contract with an option amendment is within  the min/max tariff rate or needs to be filed as a negotiated rate? The  option fee is converted to a per-Dth, per day rate and added to the transport  rate. If the total exceeds the maximum tariff rate, it's ""negotiated"".

Ten percent of the project would be new construction and the remainder  would be conversion of the crude oil line to gas service. The pipeline  system would be divided into an East Zone and a West Zone. The East Zone,  which will begin in the San Juan Basin and end at the California border, will  have 87,500 Dth/d of available capacity. The West Zone, wholly within  California, will have 120,000 Dth/d. Southern Trails received certificate authority for the project on July  28,2000. An optional certificate application does not require any showing of  market need; however, Southern Trails did hold an open season from Sept. to  Oct. 1998 during which it received 22 bids totalling 810,000 Dth/d of  demand. The order issuing the certificate did not say how much of the  capacity had been subscribed, only that Southern Trails had contracted with  its affiliate, Questar Energy, for 30,000 Dth/d of firm capacity in theh East  Zone for 5 years and one month, and taht firm transportation service  agreements of 5 and 10 year terms are ""being negotiated"" with prospective  shippers which, if executed, would subscribe the balance of the capacity in  both the East and West zones.

The parties have been ordered to appear and  show cause at a hearing (to be scheduled by the assigned ALJ) demonstrating  that:   - SDG&E has adequate gas and transmission supply for the 2000/2001 winter  heating season, as well as the longer term throughout the year. If such  supply is not adequate, SDG&E shall submit plans for obtaining an adequate  supply. - SDG&E's gas and transmission supply is adequate to meet anticipated need  for gas-fired electric generation. If not, SDG&E shall submit plans for  obtaining adequate supply. - SDG&E's  gas transmission service is not being adversely affected by  interests of its corporate affiliates. - Recently added demands on SDG&E's capacity are not negatively impacting  supply for SDG&E's customers, and are otherwise consistent with  representations to the Commission. - SDG&E's current gas curtailment rules are just and reasonable; if not,  SDG&E shall propose changes. A written response from the three parties on these issues is due on November  22. Other parties may file comments on the response within 10 days after the  response is filed. The Commission also ordered SDG&E to evaluate whether an interim,  interruptible program, which will provide cost incentives to those customers  voluntarily electing interruptible service, is needed this winter. If so,  SDG&E must submit a proposal for expedited Commission consideration. The OII represents the Commission's response to an Advice Letter filed by  SDG&E requesting emergency review and approval of its proposal to temporarily  revise the gas transportation service level elections of its large electric  generation customers.

4573,_394.subject,"From astrology.com (must I beware of overindulgence in such websites?) I like the part about charm and charisma and think it is very true. Sagittarius and Sagittarius When two Sagittarians join together in a love match, the truth-loving natures  makes theirs a near perfect relationship. This couple views the world around  them with an educated eye and both share an intense hunger for more  knowledge. They will engage one another in pleasant conversation and  banter that challenges and tickles the mind. An occasional hotheaded dispute  can erupt in the Sagittarius-Sagittarius relationship, when one fact-fanatic  Sag  partner carries things a little too far. Easygoing and independent, these two  are  compatible when it comes to balancing personal interests. They've never known  jealousy, and each partner keeps busy with personal projects when not with  their  lover. When they are together, however, they do all they can toward pleasing  their partner and satiating common interests. Although they are adaptable  and  modern, they can, at times, fly off the handle. However, it is not in the  Archer's  nature to hold a grudge or let disagreements fester very long. Sagittarius is ruled by the Planet Jupiter (Luck). Expansion is the key word  here;  as both partners enjoy the acquisition of knowledge, they will carry over  exciting  ideas into their relationship. They must be mindful of over-indulgences, as  such  gluttony will only distract them. Their charm and charisma make them a very  pleasant couple not only to one another, but the entire crowd.",hooked on astrology,scott-s

4578,_408.subject,"Maria and Drew, this is a long-winded e-mail but please bear with me... The problem:  As you probably remember, several months ago several of us met to discuss the  following language in the ROFR portion of Transwestern's tariff: ""if the rate  bid exceeds the maximum tariff rate, then the rate will be considered to be  the maximum tariff rate,"" and the additional frustrating language ""[a]ll  available capacity shall be allocated under these procedures . . ..""  At our  last meeting, we concluded that probably the best way to ensure that TW could  capture the true value of the capacity would be to link the negotiated rate  to index prices. However, since this usually involves an unacceptable amount  of risk to both the shipper and TW, the marketers haven't done any  index-based rates and have no current plans to enter into any such deals. I  have been asked by the Commercial Group to revisit this issue and to think of  other ways we could increase our ability to charge more than the maximum  rate. Ideally they would like to eliminate the language I've quoted above. However, my research has indicated that absent our 1) bringing about radical  change in the way FERC thinks about recourse rates or 2) showing that TW  lacks market power, we are probably stuck with this language. Why the problem exists (you may already know):  Steve Stojic and I did some looking into why the language is in our tariff in  the first place. In the Alternative Rates Policy Statement (RM95-6-000), the  Commission explained that it is willing to entertain individual requests for  negotiated rates, but only where customers retain the ability to choose a  cost-of-service based tariff rates. ""[T]he availability of a recourse  service would prevent pipelines from exercising market power by assuring that  the customer can fall back to cost-based, traditional service if the pipeline  unilaterally demands excessive prices or withholds service. Thus, the  recourse rate mitigates market power."" The Commission went on to confirmed that under ROFR provisions the highest  rate that an existing shipper must match if it wishes to continue its  transportation arrangement is the maximum tariff rate. This policy is clearly  not limited to ROFR situations:  when capacity is constrained, a shipper  willing to pay only the recourse rate cannot lose access to capacity merely  because someone else is willing to pay a negotiated rate. ""When there are  more requests for capacity than there is capacity available, then the  pipeline must allocate capacity among those shippers willing to pay either  the negotiated rate or the maximum recourse rate, for example on a pro rata  basis if required by its tariff."" The example cited by the Commission:  If a  pipeline has 100 Dth/d available and two shippers request that capacity, one  who is willing to pay no more than the recourse rate of $5 and another a  negotiated rate of $6, then each would be allocated 50 Dth/d on a pro rata  basis (assuming the tariff provided for pro rata allocation and not some  other allocation method such as lottery). When TW filed for authority to charge negotiated rates, it voluntarily added  the statement that ""if the rate bid exceeds the maximum tariff rate, then the  rate will be considered to be the maximum tariff rate."" Presumably we had  concluded that we needed to add this recourse rate related provision in order  to receive negotiated rate authority. Solutions?? I would like to know whether you concur that changing our tariff language  outright is probably out of the question. I feel as if I've really been  chasing my tail here. I have owed Lindy an answer for some time now. But I  keep coming back to our having to prove lack of market power (which, Drew, is  where I believe you were headed when we talked about this in mid-October). Steve Harris has asked whether we can just start small and remove the  recourse rate cap as to only a portion of our system. I think we would still  have to show lack of market power in order to do this. Do you agree? Stojic  warns that proving lack of market power is a lengthy and expensive  proposition. Might be worth it to us, though. Another idea is to somehow provide shippers with an incentive to pay more  than max rate. After all, we do have authority to charge negotiated rates. We've seen one instance in which one of our marketers was able to get more  than max rates for IT space based on good customer relations alone. However,  despite our wonderful relationships with most of our customers, it's unlikely  we can pull this off with any consistency. We wondered whether we might be  able to get more than max rates in the context of an auction procedure. But  I just am not convinced we could get around the Commission's requirement that  recourse rates be available. That requirement has not changed. Have either  of you seen anything to the contrary? I would like to meet with you two, plus several others I have in mind, to  discuss this, preferably early this week (Tues. or Wed.), but would like to  discuss briefly with you first.

Anyway, there were a few other things established and solidified last night by Ted - 1. By his own admission, I am definitely smarted than him (while in the past I have challenged that I had to agree last night) 2. I am a confident, probably too much so, and well-adjusted individual. Merely taking into account those two points, Ted in his present ""condition"" could never be a match for me. I would either always feel like I was carrying him or rolling over him. I'm still absolutely floored by the fact I have now dated a divorcee. Does Chuck think less of me for being duped? I hope not...he really seemed like a good (to everyone that met him).

4631,_642.subject,"I'm soooo good. The chosen path was cool, indifference. So, last night was Steak Night and with Nick and Wilson both in town we had a  really good showing. I got there about 7:30 with Nick, and the group's size  swelled to about 12+ by 8:30 - 9:00. About 8:00 I saw Kevin (Ted's pal - the  one you meet a steak night) wandering around LW's obviously in search of  someone. Can you believe it? He (Ted) knew I had organized this gathering -  I know that because Nick is working right across from he and Darren and  overheard Darren encouraging Ted's attendance (mind you Ted was not in the  email distribution) - and he had the nerve to come. Anyway, Kevin saw me and  came over to chat. He informed me that ""our friend Ted should be there  shortly"" to which I responded, ""You would know better than me at this  point"". The subject was dropped until he felt the need to raise it again. He asked if Ted and I parted on good terms/ bad terms, etc. I said there  really weren't any terms, I just hadn't heard a peep out of him for about 2  weeks. Kevin wanted to know if I was going to break a bottle over Ted's head  and cause a big scene. When I said no, I think he was genuinely  disappointed. I said in order for me to do something like that I would have  to care about the ""loss"" and that, while a week or two earlier I might have  cared a bit more, with each passing day the ""loss"" seems less and less like  much of a loss. Kevin told me I was better-off without Ted. To go even  further, he informed me that there is no way he would ever let a daughter of  his date Ted nor any of his ""girl-friends"". He said that while he thought  Ted was a great guy (i.e. fun to be around, good stories, etc.) he wasn't  good dating material. I agreed with Kevin saying ""Ted is a great guy, he  just makes a lousy man"" (don't you like that one?). I then went on to say  ""Anyway, I'm destined for bigger and better things, right?"". Kevin: ""Much  bigger and much better."" About this time my parents showed up...the plot  thickens. I introduced Kevin to my parents and since both my Dad and Kevin  were in the Navy and attended Colorado they had much to talk about. The two  of them had probably been talking for about half an hour when  ""dum-da-dum-dum"" Ted shows up. He approaches our group because he sees Kevin  and is forced to make eye-contact with me. I give him a ""hey"" and he gives  me the arm squeeze and a much too pleasant ""how's it going?"". He asked what  Kevin and my Dad were talking about, I told him the Navy, he said don't get  Kevin started or you'll never shut him up...Then he walked away. He never  acknowledged my parents nor did he ever speak to me again the rest of the  evening. The beautiful thing is Kevin stays and talks with my Dad for  another half hour and when Darren shows up he hangs out with ""my group"" for  quite a while before going to join Ted. My parents and I ate our steaks  right behind Ted and then went back over to our group at the picnic table  when we were finished. It really was a great night. I would almost say I  was glowing (I was having so much fun with my friends and family and it  wasn't a show for Ted's benefit...I really was having a great time). So,  when my parents decide to head out they walked over to Ted/Kevin's table to  say good-bye to Kevin. It was awesome. Ted's sitting right next to Kevin  while Kevin and my Dad are talking and appears to be actually shrinking in  his chair. Yet again no acknowledgement of my parents - he couldn't even  make eye-contact. I ended up staying there for at least another hour and  then went with a few of the guys to the Ale House. Needless to say I was  very hung over today. Anyway, there's the story...He's a complete and utter  ass-hole. So I'm done. And no, there is no way he could weasel his way back  in to my good graces.

Texas won 52-10, and you wouldn't know if from the score but the  1st quarter was a little bit scarey (0-10).

We discuss  UCLA and UT football for  a while...I of course get riled up. He informs me  that he is going to be trading corn (yes, you heard me corn) for Enron. While he is very excited about trading I get the impression he feels a little  overwhelmed and he is a very concerned about how much trading will limit his  vacation time. He said that he and Darren (the guy he works with) had been  meeting with consultants all week to get up to speed and therefore the week  had pretty much just been one long meeting. It is around this time that he  brings up the vacation thing and how, to his dismay, as a trader you work  when the markets are open and you're only off when they're closed. As a  result, he's decided to get in his long visit home ASAP, i.e. ""I'm leaving  tomorrow (Friday) to go to California for a week."" I make sure I heard him  correctly and yes he said leaving, tomorrow and  1 whole week (7 days) AND at  no point does he ask to get together before he leaves. So, that was  Thursday. I'm down on his floor again on Friday to talk to my old group and,  to my dismay, run in to him.

After a fulfilling life with the now dead Prince, she happily sat upon her rocking chair, watching the world go by from her front porch, with a cat named Bob for companionship. One sunny afternoon, out of nowhere, appeared the Fairy Godmother. Cinderella said ""Fairy Godmother, what are you doing here after all these years??"" The Fairy godmother replied ""Well Cinderella, since you have lived a good, wholesome life since we last met, I have decided to grant you 3 wishes. Is there anything for which your heart still yearns?"" Cinderella was taken aback, overjoyed and after some thoughtful consideration, and almost under her breath she uttered her first wish:  ""I wish I was wealthy beyond comprehension."" Instantly, her rocking chair was turned into solid gold. Cinderella was stunned. Bob, her old faithful cat, jumped off her lap and scampered to the edge of the porch, quivering with fear. Cinderella said ""Oh thank you, Fairy Godmother"". The Fairy Godmother replied, ""It is the least I can do. What does your heart want for your second wish?"" Cinderella looked down at her frail body, and said: ""I wish I was young and full of the beauty of youth again."" At once, her wish having been desired became reality, and her beautiful youthful visage had returned. Cinderella felt stirrings inside her that had been dormant for years and a long forgotten vigor and vitality began to course through her. Then the Fairy Godmother again spoke ""You have one more wish, what shall you have?"" Cinderella looks over to the frightened cat in the corner and says""; ""I wish for you to transform Bob, my old cat, into a beautiful, and handsome young man"". Magically, Bob suddenly underwent so fundamental a change in his biological make-up, that when complete he stood before her, a man, so beautiful the like of which she nor the world had ever seen, so fair indeed that birds began to fall from the sky at his feet. The Fairy Godmother again spoke: ""Congratulations, Cinderella. Enjoy your new life."" And, with a blazing shock of bright blue electricity, she was gone. For a few eerie moments, Bob and Cinderella looked into each other's eyes, Cinderella sat, breathless, gazing at the most stunningly perfect man she had ever seen. Then Bob walked over to Cinderella, who sat transfixed in her rocking chair, and held her close in his young muscular arms.

Basically the deal was that Dynegy's minimum-pay obligation  would be reduced by the amount of the fixed cost component of IT revenues  generated by El Paso's transportation of IT volumes above a historical  threshold. (The parties based the threshold on El Paso's monthly IT volumes  for the 12 months ended 9/30/97.) The volumes in excess of the threshold  were calculated and a ratio of the volumes in excess of the threshold to the  total volumes was determined; the ratio would then be applied to the fixed  cost component of all IT revenues and the resulting dollar value applied to  Dynegy's monthly reservation charge, to the extent Dynegy had not met its  minimum pay obligation for a particular month. This provision of course met with heavy opposition; however, FERC allowed  it.

4680,_795.subject,"While I don't truly fear you becoming a bitter individual as a result of  these negative experiences, I do feel the highlighted section below is now  more appropriate than ever. One must keep their eyes open and use all of the wisdom they possess when  they trust. Just as I suggested that positive experiences can cause one's  level of trust to grow exponentially, negative experiences can cause  irreparable harm. If you trust blindly or too willingly and that trust is  violated it colours every aspect of your life. There are too many people in  this world that have become bitter and cynical, not because they were born  that way but, because they handed out trust haphazardly and too many times  that trust was thrown back in their face. I don't mean to suggest from the  above that one should live in a day-to-day mind-set of distrust but rather  that they must really look at people and all the aspects which they posses. I have come to the conclusion that if you spend most of your time observing  and listening to people rather than always taking the lead you will learn a  great deal more about them and their character. The smallest acts and  statements can in fact say the most, so always be observant. (This includes  listening to what others have to say and paying attention to the opinions of  people whom you respect.) To that end I have one last comment...I am constantly amazed and periodically  reminded what fragile creatures we humans are. That beyond the hype and  self-grandizing the basic components of ourselves (our experiences, fears,  cares, concerns, needs etc.) cannot be completely disregarded and will always  be a part of us. I think that only by recognizing those components and  trying to understand their origin can we truly become stronger.",Reminder,scott-s
4681,_80.subject,"As you know, current firm contracts on Transwestern provide for delivery of  250 MMcf/d of gas to Topock. In the context of the Gallup Expansion,  Transwestern has entered into firm contracts for an additional 40 MMcf/d to  Topock. Once the Gallup expansion is built, Transwestern will have a total  of 290 MMcf/d of firm capacity under contract to the Topock delivery point:   40 MMcf/d more than PG&E has agreed to accept while PCBs continue to be  present. Bill Cordes has asked what Transwestern's potential liability to shippers  would be if PG&E's refusal to accept deliveries due to the continued presence  of contaminants causes Transwestern to have to curtail firm service at  PG&E/Topock. The legal answer is that Transwestern's tariff provides for a  reservation charge refund but does not limit the damages that could be sought  by a shipper. More specifically, Rate Schedule FTS-1 specifically provides for a  reservation charge refund if Transwestern fails to deliver gas for a firm  shipper. In December, January, February, July and August, the shipper is  entitled to a reservation charge refund for all nominated and confirmed  quantities not delivered. In all other months, the shipper is entitled to a  refund only if deliveries fall below 75% of nominated/confirmed quantities  for a period of 75 consecutive days. The tariff does not preclude a shipper  from seeking other damages resulting from Transwestern's failure to provide  service under an FTS-1 contract. A shipper whose firm service is curtailed  would likely incur damages in addition to the reservation charge, including,  for example, the cost of buying spot gas or damages resulting from the  shipper's inability to fulfill contractual obligations. Such damages could be  recovered in a breach of contract action. Not all shippers would incur such  damages because some might be willing to take delivery of gas at alternate  points if capacity is available at such points. Bill has asked Steve to work with me in quantifying our potential exposure. I could really use your help in putting a dollar amount on potential  damages. Can we meet briefly to discuss this? I'm available after the  Gallup meeting tomorrow a.m., or after lunch on Friday...or we can discuss a  meeting time for next week. Thank you.",Confidential: PG&E/Topock issue,scott-s

4692,_87.subject,"With regard to the Commission's limitations on the right of first refusal,  Order 637 provides for grandfathering of discounted long-term contracts that  are now subject to ROFR. The Commission's rationale was that grandfathering  gives all shippers notice of the new limitation and the opportunity to  re-execute current contracts. The TW Commercial Group has asked whether we  should challenge the grandfathering of existing contracts. In limiting the  right of first refusal, the Commission has expressly acknowledged that if a  customer is truly captive and has no alternatives for service, it is likely  that its contract will be at the maximum rate. Shippers that are not captive  and have alternatives in the marketplace do not need the protection of ROFR,  and the pipeline should be able to negotiate with other interested shippers  upon expiration of the contract. In light of these conclusions, there should be no reason to grandfather the  ROFR rights of shippers under existing discounted contracts. Such shippers  would not be harmed by removal of the right immediately upon the effective  date of a pipeline's tariff filing to limit the right of first refusal  (assuming the service contract incorporates tariff terms on an ""as amended""  basis). Consistent with the Commission's order, it would not be unfair to  make these shippers compete with others for the capacity upon expiration of  the contract.",Order 637: TW Comment on Rehearing Request,scott-s

Would acquisition of PNM capacity enable TW to gain control over access  to upstream capacity and supply sources in a manner which would permit TW to  limit customer choices or improperly tie use of the acquired capacity to  other pipeline services? (I think Mary Kay will be able to help us explain  the ""no tying"" part). 3. Would TW's marketing affiliates receive preferential treatment? - No TW marketing affiliate will be involved in the proposed transaction  - Acquisition of PNM capacity will not result in any undue preference or  advantage to any affiliated entity. 4. Will TW as a holder of capacity receive preferential treatment over PNM's  customers, to the detriment of PNM's customers? - No. PNM will be making the capacity available to TW only during periods  in which it has unused capacity available on its system, so any impact on PNM  shippers should be minimal. - Service contract under PNM's tariff does not provide for unduly  preferential treatment of TW. 5. How will capacity be managed or otherwise integrated into TW's existing  open access operations? - TW will enter into service agreements with PNM from time to time to  transport gas on the portion of PNM's line from Blanco, NM (i.e., the Blanco  Hub operated by TW) to Rio Puerco, NM, where PNM's system interconnects with  TW's mainline. Resulting available capacity will be posted according to TW's  tariff. - The capacity will be used to serve customers under TW's FTS-1, LFT and ITS  (right?) rate schedules from the Blanco receipt point to delivery points on  TW's system. - Lorraine -- we need to discuss our arrangement with PNM -- Would we be",Acquisition of PNM capacity,scott-s

Even when any  transaction is executed, you are unable to determine net payments owed by  either party until termination of the deal. Brent thinks that the tax will  be based on the product of the [Fixed Price  X volume X term] even though the  master agreement will merely provide for netting. Can you verify?

Will he also raise the ""other agreements"" issue here? Not a clue. (2)   If Cargill leaves part A in tact and we agree to change part B, I'M  FINE. (I'm fine without part B, actually)  (3)  The potential problem is that Cargill and ENA view part A differently,  right off the bat. I think Cargill is wrong because they don't read part A  as applying to ""other agreements between the parties"". But Cargill proposed  part A and it DOES apply to ""other agreememts between the parties."" I don't  want to start off on the wrong foot so I'm sure I'll have to discuss this  again with Marty.

I believe that it is intended to eliminate any  confusion that historically arose during the debate between ""First Method""  (one-way payments) and ""Second Method"" (two-way payments) for Early  Termination purposes. Although I can't find a good reason to continue to use  this provision with an ISDA (except that it emphasizes the point), I can  understand why we may have added it to a pre-ISDA agreement with a  governmental. The only example that I could locate was our September 21,  1995 Master Agreement with Reedy Creek Improvement District. For those of  you who have never seen this form, it was one of the two types of master  agreements developed by ECT before we became conversant with ISDA. Because  these forms didn't contemplate municipal counterparties, we had to add many  of the ISDA U.S. Municipal Counterparty Schedule provisions. The Part  5(b)(k) provision originally appeared in this early agreement. It was  included in the ""Event of Change"" section [5F(4)] (which is tantamount to the  ISDA concept of ""Illegality"", a ""Termination Event""). I think it was  probably included because in the ISDA, Second Method is the automatic payment  method if the parties fail to make a specific designation for Early  Termination purposes, but there isn't a comparable provision in the old ECT  form.","""Termination Payments"" - Part 5 (b)(k) to the ISDA Master Agreement",shackleton-s

4917,_1828.subject,"Mark:  I scheduled a meeting with you at 4:30 pm today to discuss the MG  acquisition, in particular, MG London, Inc. (a U.S REGULATED NYMEX clearing  member, FCM, CTA). NO ONE is looking into this from a US regulatory/legal  perspective and I think it should be the swap group. Enron's ""regulated""  product areas are metals (since MG clears its own trades on the NYMEX/COMEX  and has FCM/CTA status) and potentially agriculture if we (some Enron entity)  choose to become a regulated ""ATOM"" (ag trade option merchant). From a legal  perspective, I think we should have a ""whitepaper"" drafted by Sullivan &  Cromwell, and, it should include an analysis of the MG London, Inc. existing  situation. This would tie into the ag regulation. Also, have you thought  about ENA and MG as NYMEX members and whether we keep both designations,  whether we move all/part of ENA's existing clearing business to MG (and  perhaps eliminate the need for margin/brokering arrangements such as Paribas,  etc.) and any other related issues?

How is this right of termination (and the multiple  requests) to be documented?

It was negotiated for a prepay several years ago and is not  necessarily market (or ENA) standard. It should be reviewed immediately by  legal and credit. (2)  The Morgan Stanley Capital Group master agreement is very old. IT IS  NOT AN ISDA . It is a 1992 Master Energy Price Swap Agreement (limited to  simple transactions and commodities). The terminology is not even ISDA  terminology. This master has been on the credit/legal radar screen for  upgrading to an ISDA.

ENA  generally sends an invoice when the counterparty owes a payment (but not   when ENA owes a payment). The invoice reflects the outstanding transactions  for a given Calculation Period and the net amount owed. ENA can   generate  this invoice in all cases. Does EWEB intend that BOTH parties always send  reciprocal invoices? Is is necessary that the Calc Agent ALSO  make a phone  call? What does EWEB's language ""separate invoices and documentation  covering each Transaction sufficient to permit the other   party to comply  with its interanl accounting and record keeping procedures concerning  individual Transactions"" mean?

The reason is that bankruptcy protection for swap agreements  requires a single agreement for all swap transactions.

5338,_6034.subject,"Ellen:  I've reviewed WestLB's optional early termination language which is similar  to the other's which I've reviewed (e.g., Goldman, Chase, Merrill, etc.). Here's how it works for your 3/26/01 - 3/26/21 swap:  (1)  March 28, 2011 is the ""Break Date"" or ""Early Termination Date"". (2)  Either party can give notice of early termination to the other party on  the day that is 5 NY Business Days prior to the Break Date. By the way, this  is also the day on which the parties must mutually agree on 5 leading dealers  in the relevant market in case the valuation process in (3) below is later  disputed by the other party. (3)  The party giving notice determines (in good faith) the Cash Settlement  Amount as of 11 a.m. NY time on the Break Date (which should be the  mid-market value of the deal on the Break Date. (4)  Payment will occur on the Break Date. (5)  I am adding a provision requiring the exercising party to notify the  other party on the day that is 3 NY Business Days prior to the Break Date. There may be a dispute over the calculation and the parties will need to  resolve. (6)  If the parties cannot agree on the Cash Settlement Amount calculation,  then the party who gave notice seeks mid-market quotes from the 5 leading  dealers (previously agreed to) at 11 a.m. on the day that is 2 NY Business  Days before the Break Date. The confirm describes how the quotes are  averaged. A minimum of 3 quotes is essential. Payment is still made on the  Break Date. George:  (1)  Please verify that the Break Date is 3/28/11. My copy is a little fuzzy  and the date could actually be 3/26/11. (2)  I've marked the confirm and faxed it to you. Please note that:   (a)  the second paragraph purports to incorporate the 1991 ISDA Definitions  but the master overrides this language because it incorporates the 1991  Definitions ""as amended, modified, superceded or replaced from time to time""  (i.e., the 2000 ISDA Definitions). There is a problem if  WestLB disagrees  because I've left some language in Paragraph 3 ""as is"" since it is based upon  the 2000 ISDA Definitions.

5453,_810.subject,"I am trying to distinguish these two types of entities both practically (what  are we able to negotiate) and legally (what do we really need in our  Schedule). I am also interested in your experiences in dealing with these  parties. ENA's form of ""municipal"" Schedule (""the ENA Schedule"") was essentially  taken from the 1992 ISDA U.S. Municipal Counterparty Schedule (""the ISDA  Schedule""). In addition to other provisions, the ISDA Schedule (1) adds reps  designed to avoid ""an Orange County"" type meltdown and (2) incorporates the  concept of ""Incipient Illegality"" (which occurs before the Termination Event  of  Illegality). The ""Incipient Illegality"" concept is used  in Section  2(a)(iii) (obligations) as well as the Section 3 (reps) of the ISDA  Schedule:   the concept is added to the Section 3(b) rep (""..absence of Event  of Default, Potential Event of Default, Incipient Illegality...), and for  purposes of notifying the other party of its occurrence. Interestingly  enough, the ENA Schedule does not include the Section 3(b) rep change. I  think we need to add this change to ENA's Schedule. With respect to IOUs, we need to clarify our position on ""Regulatory  Development"" (which is actually a watered-down ""Incipient Illegality""  concept). If such an event occurs, ENA should be advised of the event  (Notice). But, does ENA really want the ability to terminate trades at  mid-market (""Additional Termination Event"") or simply to have this event  included as part of a Section 3(b) rep such that the occurrence of the event  merely triggers an Event of Default at ENA's side of the curve (for breach of  the Section 3(b) rep)? I have found that negotiating with IOUs for the ""Notice"" provision can be  difficult. Extracting the Additional Termination Event is tough. Arguing  for a Section 3(b) change may be easier (and would mirror the municipal  format). I think ENA really needs the ability to decide when to halt trading  with a counterparty experiencing a Regulatory Development (which we may only  learn about through notice from the counterparty). Thus, I recommend that  for IOUs, we add a notice provision and Section 3(b) rep change incorporating  our latest definition of ""Regulatory Development."" But we really have to  negotiate for this protection. Otherwise, why bother to include this  additional language?

(2)  I suggest that we ask Canadian counsel to review Canadian utilities on  authority/regulatory issues. In my experience, Canadian outside counsel was  reluctant to even comment on utilities located in provinces other than  outside counsel's domicile. (3)  The online omnibus does not contain the ISDA Section 3(c) rep as to  absence of litigation. This rep drags in governmental bodies and all  agencies (hence, a state PUC). Thus, online parties will rep as to authority  to transact each time they trade but we will not know about potential PUC  issues.

5477,_873.subject,"Per our conversation with Dan F., ENA needs to understand issues related to  the distinction between ""investor owned utilities"" (or ""IOUs"") and municipal  utilities (or ""municipals"") in connection with derivatives activity. In the  U.S., this distinction enables us to treat IOUs as general corporates. Thus,  we negotiate our standard ISDA Master with an IOU, except that we add an  Additional Termination Event to prevent the IOU from taking an adverse stance  in its state public utility commission proceedings. A copy of that  Additional Termination Event is attached for your review. Our approach with  respect to municipals is dramatically different. When negotiating an ISDA  Master with municipals, we use a Schedule modeled after the 1992 U.S.  Municipal Counterparty Schedule, having additional reps, the added concept of  ""Incipient Illegality"" and an enforceability opinion. A copy of that  Schedule is also attached for your reference. We would like to understand whether this distinction also exists in Canada,  and if so, in all Canadian provinces, and whether there is a distinction when  a municipal is an investor in an IOU (as we understand that the government  may assist a utility to emerge from bankruptcy).

Item (4) should read ""The payment of a ""project fee"" equal to 2% of the  project's total cost upon the achievement of the milestone described in  Exhibit B to this letter. Exhibit A should read as follows:  Individual milestones subject to ""project fee"" payments:  1. With respect to Haywood Power I, L.L.C. (""Haywood Power""), the abandonment  by the Tennessee Valley Authority (""TVA"") of its proposed 320 MW expansion of  its Haywood County, Tennessee facility (""Lagoon Creek""), which results in  Haywood Power being allowed by TVA to interconnect into an existing 500kV  open bus position in the Lagoon Creek substation. Achievement of this  milestone shall be evidenced by the interconnection specifications set forth  in an Interconnection Agreement between TVA and Haywood Power, and the  milestone shall be deemed to be achieved upon execution of said  Interconnection Agreement. 2. With respect to Haywood Power, the decision by TVA to eliminate the  Network Upgrade related to the reactive power requirements as set forth in  Haywood Power's System Impact Study, presently estimated at a total cost of  $5 million. Achievement of this milestone shall be evidenced by the Network  Upgrade requirements set forth in an Interconnection Agreement between TVA  and Haywood Power, and the milestone shall be deemed to be fully achieved  upon execution of said Interconnection Agreement to the extent such Network  Upgrade cost is eliminated. To the extent that such Network Upgrade cost is  less than $5 million, but greater than zero, a pro rata portion of the  $175,000 project fee shall be paid. 3. With respect to Calvert City Power I, L.L.C. (""Calvert""), the elimination  of TVA's present requirement for Calvert to pay for a Network Upgrade  consisting of the construction of a new 30 mile 500kV transmission line from  Cumberland to Montgomery. Achievement of this milestone shall be deemed to  occur upon (i) Calvert having determined in its sole and absolute discretion  that the overall project economics of its 510 MW generation facility are  viable, and (ii) execution of an Interconnection Agreement between TVA and  Calvert. Exhibit B should read as follows:  The development and construction of a generating facility in cooperation with  or partnership with certain distributors of the TVA (a ""Development  Project""). Any such Development Project shall initially be proposed by Wyatt  or Sideview Partners, Inc.exclusively  to Enron. Enron shall have thirty(30)  days to make a determination as to whether to proceed with any proposed  Development Project. Enron shall not have any obligation to proceed with any  Development Project. At such time as all definitive agreements related to the  Development Project have been executed, the Development Project shall be  deemed to be an approved Development Project (an ""Approved Project""). For  purposes of payment of the project fee, the milestone shall be deemed to be  achieved, for Approved Projects only, 50% upon the commencement of  construction of the Approved Project, and 50% upon commencement of commercial  operation of the Approved Project.

5530,_226.subject,"Tim  I thought I would give you a simple overview of the gas market. This may  help you prepare for Thursday. Everyday roughly 55 Billion Cubic Feet of gas is produced. The bulk of this  production is in Texas, Louisiana, and Oklahoma. In the winter, the US daily  load is greater than 55 BCF and in the summer, the daily US load is less than  55 BCF. Therefore, storage fields are needed to smooth out the seasonal  differences in load. Texas and Louisiana are two of the largest consumers of natural gas. However  these states produce more gas than they consume. Most other states consume  more gas than they produce. Therefore pipelines were built to solve the  regional imbalances. Most of these pipelines originate out of LA and TX and  move gas to the areas of greatest demand. Our goal is to gain a handle on where the daily production is moving and if  the daily production is growing or shrinking. Very simplistic, but maybe it helps. Hunter",Gas Market,shively-h

5571,_109.subject,"Phillip,  I'm building a sheet for each person specifically for financial hedging. Each day it will pull in the previous days position and previous day price  curve to calculate the mark to market. Then that day's transactions can be  entered to calculate the P & L of transactions which close out previous  positions, as well as to calculate the new open positions. Initially, I  thought that daily P&L could be calculated by simply adjusting the P&L  whenever a transaction was made by the difference between the bid/offer of  the closed out position by the offer/bid of the new position (of course time  value and storage costs would be included). However, this only works if the  person is 100% hedged, meaning they do not have any open positions which  require marking. As the seller of synthetic storage utilizing 100% hedging,  I should be able to do this, except for the fact that I will have size limits  on transactions that will probably leave me open here and there. The main question I have is simply, ""Should I be calculating the P&L for each  person's storage book for open and closed positions?"" Then beyond that, if  we do calculate the P&L's from the buyer side, it seems that if their storage  is not hedged, I will have to develop the market value of the storage in the  ground and the remaining capacity to mark to market it. So, I guess I could  apply the model for that purpose. Does this make sense to you? Any comments  are appreciated. Thanks. Mat",Synthetic Storage,smith-m

Credit should be consulted prior to any further trades to see if  they are okay with this given our relationships with this entity. 3. Madison Gas & Electric - will not agree to the ""or otherwise"" language in  the setoff language. Again, this is a credit issue. 4. Cargill - wouldn't review the new language because we are close to getting  a master in place with them. Sara expects this to happen in the next few  days. 5. Idacorp Energy Solutions, L.P. -  same as Cargill. I am working on this  one and their attorney owes me a response. This one may take a few weeks. 6. Formosa Plastics - this is the counterparty that sent the threatening  letter. It didn't appear from our records that we have traded financial  derivatives with them recently. 7. General Electric Company - won't accept the chnages and have failed to  tell me specifically what they object to. I will continue to follow up with  their attorney. 8. Basin Exploration, Inc. - same as General Electric. 9. TransMontaigne Product services Inc. - sent letter out on March 30 saying  they would respond in 30 days and I have never heard back from them. I will  follow up with their attorney. 10. Reliant - they didn't accept the new language that we added as clause (z)  to Section 3(e) and wanted to deal with this differently in the confirmation  as a trigger that would give us the right to call for collateral. Credit  should be alerted. 11. Devon Energy - they had in the past requested more time to review Annex A  and when I followed up with them last week, they still didn't have a response. 12. Smurfit - Stone Container - same as Devon energy. 13. Public Service Gas & Electric Company - we are close to finalizing an  ISDA with them.

5693,_2479.subject,"Jack: Enclosed is a new draft of the Schedules marked against the previous draft. I believe that this draft responds to most of the issues raised in your  e-mails. Just a few additional thoughts:  1. Since we will be redoing all of the existing confirms to refer to this  Master, I did not change the language that states that conflicts between the  Confirms and the Agreement are resolved in favor of the Confirm. I think  that the language as written works. 2. On the setoff language, when we are the Non-Defaulting Party, we can only  pull in other agreements between our affiliates and inland so I don't see how  this language would impact any agreements between ENA and guaranty Bank  unless Inland is the Non-Defaulting party. 3. With respect to Disruption Fallbacks, our view is that if the Confirm  specifies a Fallback reference Price that after Postponement, you would use  that price if available. I think that the language works as drafted. 4. On cash collateral, the Qualified institution concept only applies when  the non-posting party is a Defaulting party or has a Credit rating below the  threshold. Otherwise the non-posting party can hold the collateral and do  whatever it wants to with it. Your are correct that in practice this cash  gets commingled with corporate funds and swept into the party's bank account  but there is no requirement taht it work that way.

On cross default threshold, they wanted it to be the same as the  collateral threshold but my notes indicate that they were okay leaving it at  $100,000. 2. In lieu of receiving financials from them, we had agreed to accept  quarterly and annual Lease Operating Statements. Did I use the correct  term? Do we need a definition for this or is it understood what these  statements are? I am also assuming that they are internally prepared. Is  that correct? My notes indicate that these would be provided within 90 days  after quarter end. 3. We agreed to a collateral threshold for them of $500,000. 4. For the MAC trigger, is the only test the Net Cash Flow/Revenue test and  if so, what would trigger the MAC? Are there other triggers? We used to  have Funded Debt/Partners Capital, EBITDA Coverage Ratio and Minimum Partners  Capital tests. Alos, here are my proposed definitions:  Cash Flow means Net Income plus depreciation and non-cash charges minus  capital expenditures as shown on the income statement. Net Income means gross revenues and other proper income credits, less all  proper income charges, including taxes on income. Revenue is cash received from the sale of oil, gas and plant products. Should there be references to the Lease Operating Statements in these  definitions? 5. All Performance Assurance would be rounded up to multiples of $10,000. This is all that I have.

By letter addressed to you dated April  6, 2000 (the ""Termination Letter""), Guarantor terminated its obligations  under the Guaranty.

They have amended the definition of Specified Indebtedness. I'm not sure  I understand  why if we have a threshold amount they need the first part of  the language and wanted your thoughts on this. Alos, does the second part of  the language need to be updated or revised in any manner? 2. They have deleted the concept of Credit event Upon Merger. 3. They have added to Specified Transaction a Physical Master Agreement which  makes this part of the cross default to specified transaction Event of  Default trigger. Should we specify a threshold? 4. They have added an additional termination event that contains some unusual  ratings triggers. For example, are we rated by the 2 bond rating services  that they describe, and if not, doesn't that trigger clause (2) of this  additional Termination Event? I don;'t think the cure language works and I  don't understand how it works with the collateral threshold since the trigger  for that to go to zero is something else. 5. I'll just note that setoff rights do not currently apply if there is a  Termination Event that is caused by Tax Event or Tax Event Upon Merger. 6.

In the definitions of ISDA and Equity Definitions, please add amendments  and supplements  Harrier/Talon Schedule  1. We need to discuss footnotes 2, 3, 6, 9, 12, 13 2. I think that the mechanics for putting up the LC that is described in the  Additional Termination Event that was added as clause (iv) needs to be  drafted somewhere to address, for example, drawing conditions, what happens  when Enron's credit rating improves, the comment made in footnote 6 etc. 3. In Part 4, Section (a) and in all of the notice sections the notice that  goes to the AGC of the Trading Group goes to Enron North America Corp. not  Enron Corp.  4. In Part 5, Section (l)(Recording) please add after the word ""parties"" the  phrase ""in connection with the Transactions hereunder."" 5. In Part 5, Section (o) (Confidentiality), is the class of permitted  discloses in clause (iv) too broad? Talon/Enron Schedule  1. In Part 1, Section (h) should a carve out from the definition of  Identified Event be the new Termination Event that was added? 2. Why is Part 5, Section (n) in this Schedule? 3. Same comments as above  Master Derivatives Agreement  1. Is the defined term Net Premiums worded right for purposes of the  $400,000,000 limitation? For some reason, I'm thinking that a and b should  be reversed. Talon Note  1.

We went  back to RMS and told them basically that all we were willing to do was  transfer them the URL domain name with no strings attached.

With respect to the Options rep and the ESP rep in part %, Section (b), I  believe that both parties need to make such reps. The rep in Part 5  (b)(g)(ii) is to cover the Trade Option exemption and it is different from  the ESP rep below it. 3. With respect to the language in Part 5, Section (a), this is different  from the setoff language. What this is saying is that if a party has  fulfilled all of its payment obligations and an Event of Default occurs with  respect to it (the ""Defaulting Party""), the other party cannot withhold any  payment that it owes to the Defaulting Party. This is different from the  exercise of setoff rights. 4.

On our last ultrasound we got  the news taht we were hoping for with respect to the placenta problem and so  I've got the green light basically to do whatever I want to do although I am  still taking it easy and swimming alot. The baby weighed about 4 pounds a  few weeks ago and everything looked great so I was quite relieved. Now I'm  trying to spend what little free time I have getting ready. the people here  at work are having a baby shower a week from Friday so hopefully that will  help since other than some of Arthur's clothes I am starting from scratch. Work is going well although I am looking forward to winding down in a few  weeks. I'm hoping that I can work up until the very end to maximize my time  off but we will see how that goes. I really feel great except for being  uncomfortable at night and not getting much sleep but i suppose that this is  good practice for when the baby comes. Arthur is doing great. We got him 2 gerbils as a substitute for a larger  pet! They're pretty cute, small, clean and so far easy to maintain. He is  still heavily into baseball and was just selected for the All-star team which  we were absolutely thrilled about as was he! He called dad practically every  day that he was trying out for the team to give him an update and I'm hoping  that dad can fly down for the tournament this weekend. Arthur would  be on  cloud nine if he came. We'll see. Mom and dad offerred to keep Arthur for a  week over the summer and we are looking into that. I'm toying with the  possibility of sending him when the baby is born, but  I'll just have to see  how it works out. I would really love for you and mom to come once the baby  is born. Do you have any thoughts on that? You are obvious;y welcome at any  time, but i sense from mom taht she would prefer to wait until sometime in  august. Let me know what you think. How is Cindy doing?

Calculation Agent - they want to be the Calculation Agent. Since we have  no CSA with them, this means that they would be doing all of the calculations  required under each transaction that we enter into with them. Specifically, the CA does the following:  - calculates the Floating Price and the Floating Amount, Fixed Amount or Cash  Settlement Amount payable - gives notice of Settlement and Payment Dates - determines whether a Market Disruption Event has occurred  Also, my notes indicate that we agreed to increase the Guaranty  cap to  $25,000,000 from $15,000,000. Is that okay with you? They had initially  requested no cap. On Reliant Energy Services, Inc., you were going to think about the following  credit issues:  1. Specified Transaction - they want to include physical energy deals. You  were going to think about this and whether we needed a cap. They wanted to  amend the definition of Specified Indebtedness to deal with this, but I think  you and I felt taht it should be dealt with in the definition of Specified  Transaction. 2. Cross Default threshold - is 3% of equity okay? 3. On Credit Event Upon Merger, they want to define ""materially weaker"" as  either (1) being below investment grade by either S&P or Moody's or (2) being  failed to be rated by either S&P or Moody's. 4. On setoff, they did not have the ""affiliate"" language. 5. In the CSA, they want the collateral that is posted to secure both  financial deals and physical gas and power deals entered into between ENA and  Reliant Energy Services, Inc.  6. In the collateral threshold, they have proposed a matrix of S&P and  Moody's ratings, with the threshold amount being the lower of the 2 ratings. AA-/Aa3 and above  $20,000,000 A-/A3 to A+/A1   $15,000,000 BBB/Baa2 to BBB+/Baa1  $10,000,000  BBB-/Baa3  $5,000,000   Also, they have defined MAC  to be going below BBB- by S&P or below Baa3 by  Moody's or a failure to be rated by either S&P or Moody's. 7.

5842,_655.subject,"Mark and Sara: Tana came into my office last night and seemed to be very upset about how the  other 2 legal assistants were treating her, especially Susan Bailey, and also  about the fact taht Susan Bailey was going to be part of Samantha's training  and that this was a surprise to her. On the latter issue, I explained to her  that given that the 2 Susan's were involved in the day to day routine, it  made perfectly good sense for 1 of them to handle this part of Samantha's  training especially since Tana was now out of the day to day stuff. I am  very concerned that Tana is going to interfere with Susan's training process  given her attitude toward the whole thing which I really feel is ridiculous. The only possibly valid point that she might have is the fact that we didn't  tell her that this was going to work this way, but even so, again it's Tana's  way of not be able to let go and not being a team player. I explained to her  that both she and Tana had different roles to play with respect to Samantha's  training and that they both were important and taht in my opinion, Susan was  more than qualified to handle this part of Samantha's training. On the first point, I told Tana that the only way that this group is gong to  work better is through ""communicating"" to each other. I firmly believe taht  there are 2 sides to this and taht all 3 of them are guilty of treating the  other 2 at time in a not so pleasant way. Tana of course will not admit  this. I have no answers for this issue other than the fact that I am tired  of hearing about why they can't get along. I also told Tana taht it was my  perception that Susan Bailey has been under alot of pressure given her  increased workload and other things and taht that could explain her attitude  which even I have noticed has been a little different lately. I'm letting the both of you know about this because I don't want any of this  to negatively impact Samantha to the extent that it can be avoided. Carol",Meeting with Tana,stclair-c

I'm assuming  that in clause (i) of the definition of Debt Coverage Amount, it makes sense  to take ""future"" revenues from the preceding year and subtract from it asset  sales made during the current year? How will we know what assets sales are  made? Will the future net revenue calculation be shown on the reserve report  that we receive annually? When will this calculation be done? Are you  satisfied with their definition of Internal and External debt? 4. In Part 3(a), looks like we would only receive an annual reserve report. Is that sufficient? When should we get it?

In Part 5(f)- Assignment,  we need to decide what conditions precedent we  want to apply to the limited partnership entity that they assign it to given  the fact that once assigned, we will have no recourse to the partners, even  the GP. For example, should the LP have a minimum asset value at the time of  the transfer? It is not clear to me what assets this LP would own at the  time of the transfer and I'm assuming that we would want it to meet some  minimum credit criteria prior to such transfer. In addition, are you  satisfied with the debt and asset sale limitations? On asset sales, I think  that they need an annual limit as it is not clear to me how the $2,000,000  limit currently works.

They deleted the concept that a party holding an LC could draw on it if  there was an Event of Default, meaning that we would have to wait to  terminate and have a payment  obligation owing to us before we could draw. 6. They do not want any LC to be transferable. 7. They want the Enron Guaranty to cover our obligation to return collateral  taht has been posted to us, which I guess means that if we didn't return  collateral to them then they could go after Enron for that amount. Without  this language they would have to declare an Event of Default,  terminate and  then go after Enron for any amount that we owed them. To the extent that we  were holding cash colateral, they could offset that amount against amounts  that they might owe us. This is an interesting issue and one that I have not  seen before. 8.

I'm thinking about having a meeting with the basis traders every morning from  8:15 - 8:30 after each trader has gathered information from their desk  meetings. This would be the optimal time to strategize as a group since  changes in regional fundamentals and respective basis implications would be  fresh in everyone's mind. Would it be okay to delay EOL market-making in  basis until 8:30? I think it would be worth it. I think it would be a good idea to meet with leaders from other groups  (origination (who? ), structuring (who? ), Julie Gomez, and Fred Lagrasta) on a  regular basis to obtain new information on anything that might affect ENA's  basis positions. Could you point me in the right direction as far as whom to  involve and maybe notify them of my intentions? Should we set up a new book (under my management) which would hold certain  strategic positions such as spread trades and/or more complex structured  positions? I think it would be easier to manage that way by not being  ""cluttered up"" in different books (i.e. the P/L from these trades would be  my focus instead of managed by other traders.)

It was extended for HE 9 through 22 at a price of $160. In the spreadsheet  Real Time sends to EES each day, it shows the deal as a sale at a price of  $130, not a buy at a price of $160.

5983,_1232.subject,"Kate Symes Student No. 569430668  1. The invention of the french fry would result in an increased demand for  potatoes - that is, the demand curve for potatoes would shift outward. This  would result in an increase in price, and a corresponding increase in supply. As the supply curve comes up to meet the new, higher demand curve, we would  actually see an increase in overall demand, supply, AND price. The statement  is wrong in assuming that increased supply equals a lower price. 2. a. The value of one bottle of beer to me between points A and B is 8  bottles of soda. b. I am therefore indifferent between bundles A and B, because they both  allow me the same frequency of use and same level of satisfaction. c. Bundle E must include about 216 bottles of soda in order to make me  indifferent between it and bundle D. This follows from the logic that, when I  have 100 bottles of soda, it would take about 8 more to make me give up one  bottle of beer in the bundle. Here I have 200 bottles of soda - I would need  AT LEAST 8 bottles of soda to make me give up one more beer in another bundle  with the same frequency of use. 3. Firstly, this legislation produces a disincentive for parents to travel  with children on an airplane because it increases the already high costs  associated with flying. Add to this the somewhat more relaxed rules of the  highway, and you might find more families taking road trips on their next  vacation. This is a potential secondary effect of the legislation which could  actually increase injuries and fatalities - secondary because it would not be  directly associated with injuries caused in airplane crashes, but because it  would incent people to find other, possibly more dangerous, modes of  transportation. 4. Auto safety legislation puts constraints on auto makers to make cars as  safe as possible while still maintaining a profit. It also narrows consumers'  choice sets when buying a new car. A person buying a car in a country with no  auto safety legislation might make auto safety a priority in their decision. In a country indoctrinated by Nader's book, the choice between whether to buy  a safe or unsafe car is taken away - all cars are made equally safe. Because  of this, car-buyers have less incentive to drive safely and more leeway to  choose their car for other reasons. Soon, safety in a car becomes a moot  point and the car buyer is only concerned with a good price or other  incentives. Auto accidents increase because there is no longer an incentive  to drive safely - legislation has made cars, in consumers' minds,  indestructible. If cars are indestructible, so then are the people in them. 5. a. My demand curve shows that I would purchase 1 gallon of soda at a price  just under $10. So when I purchase 5 gallons at $5 a gallon, I am better of  by $12.50. b. I can purchase 3 more gallons of Diet Coke when it is priced at $3 a  gallon than when it's priced at $5. Therefore, I'm better off by $2.50 - a  gain of 3 gallons times a decrease of $2 divided by 2.  c. If Diet Coke was free, I'd consume up to 10 gallons of it before it  wouldn't be worth it for me to consume anymore. My consumer surplus is $50. 6. a. A will sell chairs to B. A can make 5 chairs in the time it takes him  to build 1 table, while B can only build 3 in the time it takes him to build  a table. (A's chair-to-table time ratio is greater than B's - 1/2 to 1/3.) b. A will buy tables from C. C can make a table in only twice the amount of  time it takes him to build a chair, while A takes five times as long to build  a table than a chair. (A's table-to-chair time ratio is greater than C's - 5  to 2.) c. B will do neither. Since B can make chairs faster (rate of 1/3 for B to  1/2 for C), B won't buy chairs from C. And because C can make tables faster  (rate of 2 for C to 3 for B), B can't sell tables to C.  7. a. The equilibrium price is $3.96.",Econ 201 Homework 1,symes-k

6065,_598.subject,"The Dow Jones report is compiled of data sent from many different  counterparties. The lovely people at Dow Jones painstakingly analyze the data  to ensure its accuracy. Averaged together, these prices become the Dow Jones  daily index price. And that's the long and short of it. The process, as you've guessed by now, is a little more complicated than  that. For one thing, Dow Jones looks at each counterparty's sales to reach an  average of all the prices. It would be redundant for each counterparty to  ALSO report their purchases from each other. Therefore, when calculating the  Dow Jones data, we only include purchases from counterparties who ARE NOT  participants in the Dow Jones survey. Following is a simple example:  Participant List  NP-15 Purchases  NP-15 Sales  Reported NP-15 Purchases  Reported NP-15 Sales Sempra  Sempra - $250   Sempra - $250  Avista - $270   Sempra - $250 Duke   Duke - $260   Duke - $260      Duke - $260 Enron   Avista - $270   Avista - $270      Avista - $270  Now that's simple! Following is the participant list for Dow Jones' survey of trading at NP-15  and SP-15 delivery points. Deals with these counterparty names need to be  excluded from the calculation of PURCHASES at NP-15 and SP-15 delivery points.

6126,_109.subject,"One day, while walking down the street, a highly successful lawyer was  tragically hit by a bus and killed. His soul arrived up in Heaven, where he  was met at the Pearly Gates by St. Peter himself. ""Welcome to Heaven,"" said St. Peter. ""Before you get settled in, though, it  seems we have a problem. You see,  we've never once had a lawyer  make it  this far and we're not really sure what to do with you."" ""No problem-just let me in,"" said the lawyer   ""Well, I'd like to, but I have higher orders. What we're going to do is let  you have a day in Hell and a day in Heaven, and then you can choose whichever  one you want to spend an eternity in."" ""Actually, I think I've made up my mind...I prefer  to stay in Heaven,"" said  the lawyer    ""Sorry, we have rules,"" said St. Peter, and with that, he put the lawyer in  an elevator  and it went  down-down-down to Hell. The doors opened and the lawyer found himself stepping out onto the putting  green on a beautiful golf course. In the distance was a country club, and  standing in front of him were all of his friends and fellow lawyers with whom  he had worked. They were all dressed in black tie and evening gowns and  cheering for him. They ran up and kissed him on both cheeks and they talked  about  old times. They played an excellent round of golf, and that night went  to the country club where he enjoyed an excellent steak and lobster dinner. The lawyer even got to meet the Devil, who was actually a woman and very good  looking. He had a great time telling jokes and dancing. In fact, the lawyer  was having such a good time, that before he knew it, it was time to leave. Everybody shook his hand, thanked him for coming  and waved goodbye as he  got on the elevator. The elevator went up-up-up and opened back at the Pearly Gates, where he  found St. Peter waiting for him. ""Now it's time to spend a day in Heaven,"" he  said. So the lawyer spent the next 24 hours lounging around on clouds and playing  the harp and singing. He had a great time, and before he knew it, his  24  hours were up. St. Peter came and got him. ""So, you've spent a day in Hell and you've spent a day in Heaven. Now you   must choose your eternity,"" he said. The lawyer  paused for a second, and  then replied, ""Well, I never thought I'd say this. I mean, Heaven has been  really great and all, but I think I had a better time in Hell."" So St. Peter  escorted him to the elevator and again he went down-down-down, back to Hell. When the doors of the elevator opened, the lawyer found himself standing in  a desolate wasteland covered in garbage and filth. He saw his friends and  fellow lawyers were dressed in rags and were picking up the garbage and  putting it in sacks. The Devil appeared before the lawyer. She now had horns sticking out of her  head, fire spit out her ears and nose  and she had a very evil laugh  The lawyer stammered:   ""I don't understand. Yesterday, I was here and   there was a golf course and a country club and we ate lobster and danced and  had a great time.

6127,_110.subject,"If you didn't believe us before, I'm sure it is by now painfully clear that  negotiating master swap agreements is a very lengthy process. My impression  is that the commercial team in Portland is anxious to begin trading  financially. If this is correct, it would be possible, at least from a legal  point of view, to begin trading now under the existing documents. In each  case where a master agreement is already in place, trades entered into before  the amendments we want will certainly be binding on both parties. Our only  issues with trading under these agreements are where we need more restrictive  credit provisions and that resumption of trading before an amendment is  signed reduces to some extent our negotiating leverage. As to the credit  issue, only the credit group can decide whether or not to permit trading  under the existing terms. As for the negotiating leverage, if the commercial  people want to resume trading immediately, my suggestion would be to let them  go ahead. If it turns out that additional leverage is needed, we can always  stop trading. Where no master swap agreement exists, we have documentation available to  enable trading on a limited basis until the master is signed. The so-called  ""omnibus"" confirmation will work for any normal commodity derivative  transaction and can be customized to include necessary credit provisions -  even where multiple trades exist with the same counterparty.

6148,_1283.subject,"Dear John:  So sorry for the delay. I hope it hasn't caused too much inconvenience. I  would have called to apologize in person but believe it or not I don't have  your phone number! Here are my comments to the draft documents you sent:  Part 1 (b)  In our other derivatives trading, the cross default test applies  to Enron Corp. with a Threshold of US$100,000,000. To accomplish this in the  schedule, Threshold Amount for the Enron party would apply to our Credit  Support Provider if there is going to be an Enron Corp. guaranty and the  dollar figure adjusted accordingly. Part 1 (d)  Has Baker & McKenzie recommended this? We rely on local counsel  advice for this provision but our preference is that the termination in a  bankruptcy context not be automatic unless it needs to be. The risk in the  automatic situation is that the market moves significantly before we are even  aware of the situation, i.e. the outstanding transactions terminate  automatically, leaving us with an open, unhedged position which we are not  able to protect since we are not aware of it. In the U.S. the bankruptcy  code allows us to terminate after the filing of a bankruptcy according to the  terms of the agreement so we know exactly the time to rehedge. Part 1 (e)  We usually choose Loss here as the method which gives the  non-defaulting party the most flexibility. Market Quotation is often  suggested because of its apparent objective nature. However, in many of the  markets where we operate, quotations will not be available, where they are  available they may well not be meaningful, and the Loss method gives  flexibility (while still requiring commercial reasonableness). Part 1 (h)(ix)  This Additional Event of Default only applies when there is  no collateral annex. When we have the ability to ask for (or be asked for)  collateral in the case of a downgrading, we build that event into the  Paragraph 13 to trigger a reduction of the threshold to zero which requires  the posting of collateral to cover any open position. If the party fails, it  then becomes a default allowing termination. Part 1 (h)(x)  Wouldn't the cross default be triggered before this could  happen? Part 2  Have our internal Tax people approved this? Part 3  I am not familiar with the Representative Director concept or some of  the corporate documents referred to. Since Enron Corp. will be a Credit  Support Provider, does it have a Representative Director, etc.? The legal opinion requirement is one that we can waive if local counsel does  not think it necessary. In many non-US jurisdictions, local counsel have  advised that an opinion be obtained - in some cases derivatives transactions  are so uncommon that they might be outside the ordinary course of business  and therefore require special board approval; in others, derivatives would  not be permissible activities for a company unless express provision is made  in the corporate documents, etc. Part 5 (b) (g)&(h) These representations originate with CFTC rules in mind  (although they may be helpful for other reasons as well). If neither party  is in the US, the CFTC reason may go away. On the other hand, since we are",Japanese ISDA Documents,taylor-m

6151,_1321.subject,"It's not looking good for getting back to you today on this - shaping up to  be a very bad day and we need to coordinate with Credit for their responses  as well. I have a call in to John Suttle and have forwarded the revised  draft to him. We'll do what we can. I saw your reply to my previous note. On this one point:  It strikes me as disingenuous to say that they don't have the internal  systems for csa's with nonfinancial counterparties - the same systems would  work for nonfinancial parties as well as financial parties. IBJ is the most  sophisticated Japanese player in the derivative market and one would believe  that they could handle the documentation for both financial and non-financial  entities. I note, I have heard that it is not market practice for Japanese  financial institutions to provide collateral to non-financial institutions,  so it may be very difficult for them to alter their position. I understand. My view is just that it is probably not a systems issue but a  position and it irks me to have the point made as a systems issue when it is  not. As we both agree, the  issue may be moot depending on what Credit  thinks.",IBJ,taylor-m
6152,_1323.subject,"I've chartered in the BVI a number of times and it is a great place to take  beginners. I only caught your post of yesterday so didn't see the earlier  thread. I'm assuming you're picking up the boat in Road Town or nearby. The  only problem with getting away from the dock by 12 or so is if the boat isn't  quite ready. I've always used the Moorings so they're the only outfit I  know. They don't usually let you get started on the boat until after the  chart briefing which means you don't go aboard until 10. If you use their  provisioning service it eases that chore but sometimes the food isn't there  right on time. Having several people (but not too many) around this time is  helpful to put food away, take inventory, attend boat briefing, etc. Of  course, if you get the boat the day before - maybe with a sleepaboard option  or some such, you have that much more certainty that everything will be done  on time. Check with your charter company about attending the briefings  before sending the last person off to the airport - some companies may  require 2 people from your boat to attend. As for first day - if you are away by 1 I suggest heading over to the Bight  on Norman Island. There are lots of moorings there and you'll get one as  long as you're not in too late. It shouldn't take more than a few hours to  get there and if it looks like it might be close you can always fire up the  engine. There are a couple of places (a beach bar and a boat) to eat and  drink there if you don't feel like cooking the first night and although you  can't call it deserted or even secluded because of the number of boats there,  there is at least very little ashore to bother you. The caves are just  around the corner and the Indians right outside for great snorkeling/diving  either that afternoon or first thing the next day. Whether you go clockwise or counterclockwise doesn't really matter. My  advice running roughly clockwise:   skip Soppers Hole - just a commercial port with little of interest (unless  you're clearing customs);   skip the USVI - all the clearing out & in & out & in can take a lot of time  and there's plenty to do in the BVI - if you just have to go, the northern  shore of St. John is the best - nice anchorages (several of the 'secluded'  variety) without the crime on St. Thomas and the resort at Caneel Bay will  let you come ashore for a fancy dinner (but make reservations and leave your  trash on board - there's nowhere to put it);   Jost van Dyke is fun - anchor in Great Harbor or pick up a mooring in Little  Harbor - Sydney's Peace & Love restaurant in Little Harbor still has an honor  bar where you mix your own drinks & just keep track in his little black book  while you're waiting for dinner, Foxie's in Great Harbor is a classic beach  bar/rest. - lots of fun and good food & drinks;    Sandy Cay is everyone's image of a desert island and perfect for a lunch stop  and a swim;   don't miss Cane Garden Bay (unless the northerly swell is too heavy) there's  a wonderful swath of pure white beach with palm trees swaying overhead and  steel drum bands serenade you into the evening - watch the reefs but the  channel in is well marked;   if there's a full moon be sure to be on Tortola somewhere that night (Cane  Garden works fine) to get to Bomba's Shack for the party - there are lots of  taxis there as the evening progresses to get you back;   it's easy to pick people up (or drop them off) at the airport (close to the  water with a dinghy dock) midweek if you need to and kind of fun to be met  that way;   the Baths are a must but VERY crowded (no anchoring allowed - must use a  mooring) so I'd try to get there as early in the day as possible (Cooper  Island, Marina Cay and area by Last Resort are nearby for the night before) -  maybe get up early, motor or sail over and have breakfast once you're safely  moored - and be careful to use the right color mooring and avoid the ones  reserved for commercial craft;    I usually skip Spanish Town (Virgin Gorda Yacht Harbor) since I'd rather be  at anchor than stuck in a marina slip with no breeze, but if you stay there  you can get a taxi to the Baths and top off with water in case your crew is  not serious enough about fresh water conservation (and what crew ever is? );   the Bitter End is great for a long hot shower (I think you pay at the resort  front desk) and maybe a 'fancy' dinner and there is also a water dock there  (10 cents a gal.?). Sometimes it seems like the distances are so short you don't get to sail  enough - you shouldn't have any trouble getting a lot in (but you won't be  able to see everything). The only difficulty might be if you need to get the  boat back in for an early flight but I've let people out at Cane Garden Bay  to take a taxi to the early flight & then sailed around to have the boat back  well before noon. Having said that, I suggest Cooper Island or the Bight for  your last night - it just makes that last morning a bit more leisurely. And  just as I mentioned for the first night, it makes sense to get into most  anchorages early rather than late so you're sure to get a mooring (in those  that have them) and don't have to worry about finding a spot for the boat -  many of them can get quite crowded. Of course, if you're going anytime  between now and Thanksgiving there shouldn't be any trouble with crowds -  just pay daily, close attention to the weather forecasts! Don't expect much in the way of night life but there are places to eat at  nearly every anchorage - many are closed in the low season. A few of the  islands have some good hiking but there's not much for the sight seers  either. But snorkeling and diving are everywhere. Ask at your chart  briefing for the best spots these days. If you have divers along, don't miss  the wreck of the Rhone - you can have a dive boat come and meet you there and  bring along equipment and a guide for the divers. The cruising guide will  have lots of info on all these issues. Wish I was going - it's always a blast!",BVI,taylor-m

Hope this helps but feel free to call or write with any  questions or comments:  A:   The CFTC regulates futures contracts and certain kinds of option  contracts. SP:  What's a futures contract? A:  It is a contract for the sale of a certain kind of  commodity through a  regulated  exchange. SP:  How is the contract different than a non-futures contract? A:  Ahem,   just for your information, we call the non-futures contracts  forward or over the counter contracts. The big difference is that the  forward contract does not must go to delivery while futures contracts do not. SP:  I though the futures contracts went to delivery. I remember getting all  messed up on the gas side with delivery of NYMEX futures gas at the Henry  Hub, and what about those stories of a guys getting a load of soy beans  dumped in their front yards? A:  Well, er,  yes they do sometimes  go to delivery, but they are not really  supposed to relatively few of them go to delivery. They are supposed to   more frequently (actually the vast majority of the time) net out as financial  transactions. It's that option of settling financially that distinguishes  the futures contract. SP:  Well lets get to the point,  why are physical buy sells so bad? A:  That's easy. Because they look like futures contracts. They are not  intended to go to delivery. And if you are trading in futures contracts you  are supposed to be doing it on a CFTC regulated exchange. SP:  So what you are saying is that if we deliberately net out our physical  deals and never intend to even try to schedule delivery under them we are  trading in futures contracts and could be subject to regulation by the CFTC? A:  You've got it. But it's even worse than that - federal law says that a  futures contract which is not traded on a regulated exchange is illegal: not  only could the CFTC come after you but your counterparties could use that law  against you to get out of performing. So you can think of each contract like  that as having written a free option. SP:  Well how much physicality do we have to have to make it a forward  contract? A:  What do you mean? SP:  Well, if we settled physically one day a month but financially the other  29 days, would we have a futures contract? A:  Oh for Christ's sake I've had it.

6200,_3323.subject,"I found this on a sailing magazine web page:  An acquaintance who is a professor of literature at Stanford brought Patrick  O'Brian to my attention, claiming him to be the finest living author writing  in the English language. Being an avid reader who had consumed about  everything including, of course, all of Forster's Hornblower books, I had my  doubts. But after an increasingly mesmerizing reading of all of the sixteen  O'Brian Aubrey/Maturin novels then in print with ever mounting captivation  and awe, I wholeheartedly concurred. After a second reading of the entire  series which revealed to me previously undiscovered depths and glories I felt  compelled to pay down the debt I owed this author for the wonderful,  life-enriching experience he had given me. Since O'Brian obviously loved the  sea, it occurred to me to write offering him a fortnight's cruse aboard my  Perini ketch, the 154 foot Andromeda la Dea, for himself and his friends  without any interfering presence from myself. I asked Danielle Steel if she thought O'Brian would be offended by receiving  such a letter and her interesting reply was, ""I get about 20,000 letters per  year from readers and I have yet to receive a single one offering to do  anything for me - he will be delighted even if age and circumstances prevent  him from accepting."" So I wrote via his publisher, having literally no idea  where in the world he lived, and after some forwarding delay I received his  handwritten reply, in his fine and precise penmanship, saying ""I accept your  kind offer with perhaps obscene haste."" As Mr. O'Brian was to give a lecture tour of the United States in early 1995  that included San Francisco, I invited him to dinner the week of his visit  and I first saw him in person when I attended his lecture in Herbst Hall. His  host was the poet laureate of America (Robert Haas). I was both charmed and  alarmed when introduced to O'Brian's lightening quick wit and rather acerbic  manner. The following evening he and his wife, Mary, came to my house in Belvedere  for a 'literary' dinner with admirers and one or two other authors. Mr.  O'Brian was utterly charming, if perhaps a little aloof. He took tremendous  interest in an Admiralty Board (dockyard) model I have of an English First  Rater of 1702. He understood everything about that ship and greatly augmented  my own knowledge. After the other guests departed, we settled into a series  of brandies by the fire and I discovered: 1) his capacity for serious  drinking greatly exceeded my own; 2) his reserve only eased very slightly in  the presence of this unknown American (me) and; 3) his knowledge of the  practical aspects of sailing seemed, amazingly, almost nil. After a half liter of cognac had vanished (and we were still calling each  other Mr. O'Brian and Mr. Perkins), I produced a chart of the Mediterranean  and we began to discuss the agenda for his cruise. I had learned that the O'Brians' home was in Collioure, a village on the  Mediterranean coast of France just north of the Spanish border, in Basque  country. The harbor of Port Vendres lies nearby, where Andromeda could pick  all of them up. O'Brian then suggested a cruise circumnavigating Sicily, a  stop in Greece, dropping by Beirut and winding up with a comprehensive tour  of the Balearic islands. I was stunned! How, I wondered, could this old salt  possibly comprehend a tour of over 3,000 nautical miles with numerous port  calls, in only 14 days in a yacht capable of only about 12 knots? As I began to explain the physical limitations of time and space he added a  desire to drop the hook in Naples, Capri and Tangiers as well. While I could  not reconcile this plan with reality, I assumed it was the wine in control  and then I was both startled and pleased when he added at the evening's end  that he had a major non-negotiable condition to accepting my offer; namely  that I personally would join him, Mary and their guests aboard my yacht. ? In May 1995, as the departure date appoached, I had a rough time getting  Andromeda to the tiny and picturesque Port Vendres in time to pick them up. Every time I have been in the Gulf of Lions, I have been pasted and this was  one of the worst. Andromeda broke her inner forestay and lost all  telecommunication as well, but after a real dusting we made it and O'Brian  and Mary showed me around the village and offered a lunch at their modest and  charming home. He took tremendous pride in his wine made from his own grapes,  pressed and fermented in barrels in his cellar. I was fascinated by his  office, where the books were written. It was lined floor to ceiling with  reference works on an array of subjects (botany, geography, zoology,  medicine, etc.) in several languages, but not a single volume dated later  than 1820. He was literally immersed in the period of his work. The following morning we were joined by his close friend, the scholar (and  foremost authority on Peeps) Richard Ollard, his publisher Stuart Proffit and  his agent Vivien Green. We finalized our itinerary with the decision to visit  all the Balearic islands and O'Brian, somewhat wistfully, asked if an  additional stop in Istanbul would not be possible? Told it was not, he  boarded radiating the impression that I was something of an Indian giver,  short-changing him on his yachting holiday. Underway to Menorca beneath a sunny sky with a twenty knot following wind,  the sailing was marvelous and O'Brian was delighted. I introduced him to the  helm, but he seemed to have no feeling for the wind and the course, and  frequently I had to intervene to prevent a full standing gybe. I began to  suspect that his autobiographical references to his months at sea as a youth  were fanciful. He had no idea of the limitations of even a big yacht like  Andromeda in terms of the handling and actual distance we could cover in a  day. However, he and Mary adapted quickly to the yacht with no trace of  seasickness. Mary, quiet, kind, interesting and interested, was wonderful to  have aboard. However, she was very frail. They were both nearly 80 and I  constantly feared she would take a tumble with the ship's motion, but  thankfully this never occurred.",O'Brian article,taylor-m

The Lord says, ""Say no more,"" and fits each mouse with beautiful new roller  skates. About a week later the Lord stops by to see the cat and finds him in a deep  sleep on the pillow. The Lord gently wakes the cat and asks him how was he doing. The cat replies better  than I could have ever expected.

6218,_369.subject,"I think this is the most recent version of the ETA. Obviously, this is the  UK version and Sullivan & Cromwell are turning it into a US document. The US  version will be governed by NY law and contain an arbitration clause. We're  also trying to figure out how much to say about the confirmation process  since it may vary from product to product and will almost certainly be  different from the UK version. Speaking of which, I was surprised to find  that they have the telephone conversation (and in this case the web site  records) control over a confirmation which has been signed by both parties. What's the practice in your part of the world? One alternative is to insert  the language (or something like it) that we use in financial trading which  says that we will send a written confirm, gives the counterparty a short time  (2 or 3 days) to respond and indicates that silence will be deemed  acceptance. Would that work for your deals? Anyway, I'm in NY today and tomorrow, back in the office on Wed.  Louise is  insistent that the GTC's be available to be uploaded this weekend.

6222,_39.subject,"'Twas The Night Before Christmas as written by a lawyer  'Twas the nocturnal segment of the diurnal period preceding the annual  Yuletide celebration, and throughout our place of residence, kinetic activity  was not in evidence among the possessors of this potential (party of the  first part), including that species of domestic rodent known as Mus  musculus. Hosiery was meticulously suspended from the forward edge of the  wood burning caloric apparatus, pursuant to our anticipatory pleasure  regarding an imminent visitation from an eccentric philanthropist among whose  folkloric appellations is the honorific title of St. Nicholas (party of the  second part). The prepubescent siblings, comfortably ensconced in their respective  accommodations of repose, were experiencing subconscious visual  hallucinations of variegated fruit confections moving rhythmically through  their cerebrums. My conjugal partner and I, attired in our nocturnal head  coverings, were about to take slumberous advantage of the hibernal darkness  when upon the avenaceous exterior portion of the grounds there ascended such  a cacophony of dissonance that I felt compelled to arise with alacrity from  my place of repose for the purpose of ascertaining the precise source thereof. Hastening to the casement, I forthwith opened the barriers sealing this  fenestration, noting thereupon that the lunar brilliance without, reflected  as it was on the surface of a recent crystalline precipitation,  might be  said to rival that of the solar meridian itself - thus permitting my  incredulous optical sensory organs to behold a miniature airborne runnered  conveyance drawn by eight diminutive specimens of the genus Rangifer,   piloted by a minuscule, aged chauffeur so ebullient and nimble  that it  became instantly apparent to me that he was indeed our  anticipated caller. With his ungulate motive power traveling at what may possibly have been more  vertiginous velocity than patriotic alar predators,  he vociferated loudly,  expelled breath musically through contracted  labia,  and addressed each of  the octet by his or her respective cognomen -  ""Now Dasher, now Dancer..."" et  al. - guiding them to the uppermost exterior level of our abode, through  which structure I could readily distinguish the concatenations of each of the  32 cloven pedal extremities.",night before christmas,taylor-m

6224,_397.subject,"I'm looking forward to seeing you Friday night. I'll bring along some  sailing info. but thought I'd let you know now what we've got in mind. Dan &  Jamie are lined up so if you guys are still interested there would be 6 of  us. We have gotten a quote for a relatively new 46' sailboat in the British  Virgin Islands for the week of Thanksgiving. We'd fly down there on Saturday  the 20th, pick up the boat the next day and return either Saturday the 27th  or Sunday the 28th. [The return date is still under discussion - so far we  have (i) Jamie who wants to fly Saturday so we have a day at home before  going back to work, (ii) Mark who likes to spend as much time on the boat as  possible so wants to come back Sun., and (iii) Ted who when he heard the  question said ""Let's start back Saturday and spend the night in South  Beach!""] The charter company is the Moorings (their website is  www.moorings.com) and the specific boat we reserved is called a Moorings  463. You can see a floor plan and photos on the web but the boat has three  separate double cabins each of which has its own bathroom. Each day's schedule is usually pretty flexible - get up whenever (I seem to  remember Jamie getting up pretty early & making coffee), have breakfast on  the boat, decide where to go and sail off to the next island we've picked  out, maybe stopping at one or two interesting looking spots on the way, maybe  not. Maybe stopping for lunch somewhere, maybe making sandwiches while we  sail and maybe waiting for lunch til we stop for the day. Most days we only  actually sail for a few hours and are anchored in a little bay by 2 or 3:00  and spend the afternoon swimming (Ted's favorite), snorkeling (the masks,  etc. come with the boat), hiking on shore, exploring the coastline in the  dinghy or sitting around on the boat or beach reading, chatting, napping or  whatever (my favorite). There's a CD player and we listen to a variety of  music - luckily Ted has so far been able to restrain his heavy metal  proclivity for the duration of the trip. If you scuba dive there are dive  companies that will come meet the boat and take you on a dive trip - there is  at least one really good wreck dive (in 70 - 90') in the BVI. If you want to  learn to dive, you can take the classroom and swimming pool instruction in  NYC and do your certification dives in the BVI (Dan & Jamie might be diving,  Ted & I probably won't). Sunsets are often spectacular and signal cocktail  hour for me. There's usually at least one restaurant on shore in most of  these anchorages where we go for dinner but the charter company stocks the  boat with food (there's a fridge, stove & bbq grill on the boat) and as you  might guess Dan and Jamie are pretty good cooks so we can always eat on board  if we don' feel like going ashore. While no one is excluded from any  activities and everyone can participate in planning the itinerary, we don't  always do everything together, either. Everybody usually pitches in and  shares what work (cooking, cleaning up, sailing stuff) there is, although if  only from our keen sense of self-preservation you and Ted probably wouldn't  be expected to cook. In the past Jamie has been the only smoker and he has  invariably confined his habit to the downwind portion of the deck. As for $,  the boat, provisioning (food on board for breakfast lunch and a  few dinners), taxes, airport transfers and a hotel room for the first night  we get there all comes to about $760 per person. Extras include drinks (only  fair since you and Jamie won't be imbibing as much as the rest of us) and any  dinners ashore and of course the dreaded airfare. I've tentatively got   flights for you (through the boat company) that come to $544 per person,  though if we decide to come back on Saturday that might go down. Ted & I  usually try to see if there is some way to use frequent flyer miles but we're  not always successful. It's such a popular week to sail we need to decide  pretty soon so we can put a deposit down - the boat is not actually reserved  until we do. I'd better stop & send this - it's turned out to be a good bit longer than I  intended but I get carried away sometimes when I daydream about sailing!

Mark felt that the index should provide a more complete  description than the short description abbreviation but that the full legal  text could wait for the paper confirm. Given Mark's view as to how this field should be dealt with, it may be that  the confirm desk has in fact looked at all of these and said they look fine  as far as they go and has not attempted to correct them with the full legal  language. Mark said he would be contacting you himself but I thought it might make  sense to give you my version as well. What are your thoughts?

The due diligence required  involves asking the utility for certain information concerning their  organization and regulatory situation, hiring local counsel in the relevant  state and having research done into the laws and regulations in place there  and into any public utility commission orders respecting the particular  utility in question, and on occasion requesting an opinion letter from the  utility's counsel. We usually begin that process only when a trader believes  there is a likelihood of a sufficient volume of trading with the utility to  justify the time and expense. FYI, the due diligence process has in the past  revealed circumstances which prevented the utility from trading derivatives  or required actions to authorize such trading which had not been taken.

6246,_598.subject,"Lucy:  Tana tells me you are looking for some guidance as to which Enron entity  should be used for booking trading transactions with various counterparties. There are a couple of general rules that apply to ""normal"" trading  circumstances and I'll spell them out below, but remember that these are not  hard and fast rules and may go straight out the window when circumstances  vary (even just a little bit) from ""normal."" For example, abnormal  situations exist where the trading transaction is in connection with another  transaction with an Enron company (e.g. a financing or equity investment),  the counterparty has a legally justifiable desire to trade with a certain  Enron company, the product being traded is only traded by a particular Enron  company or the counterparty is in a jurisdiction outside the country where we  are trading (except as spelled out below). Having said all that, the  following rules (generally tax driven) can be used as general guidelines:  1. If there is no master agreement in place between the counterparty and an  Enron company, the trade should be entered into on behalf of the Enron  company based in the country where the Enron trader is when the trade is  concluded and, if there is any hope of further trading with the counterparty,  Credit and Legal should be notified to negotiate a master agreement. Of  course, if the counterparty is outside the country where we are trading,  Legal should be consulted ahead of time (there are some countries where  derivatives are actually illegal, special procedures must be followed or  can't be done by us from the U.S.). 2. If there is a master agreement between the counterparty and either ENA or  Enron Canada, and the Enron trader is in the U.S. or Canada, the trade should  be entered into by the trader on behalf of the Enron company that is party to  the master agreement. If the trader is outside of the U.S. or Canada, other  rules may apply. 3. If there is a master agreement between the counterparty and ECT  International (usually only European counterparties), and the Enron trader is  in the U.S. or the U.K., the trade should be entered into by the trader on  behalf of ECT International. Note that there are special considerations if  the trader is in the U.K. based on U.K. regulatory issues (the trade is  actually ""arranged"" by Enron Europe Finance and Trading Ltd. on behalf of ECT  International). If such a master exists but the trader is not in the U.S. or  U.K., the trade should be handed off to a trader located in one of those two  countries for final negotiation and execution. It would be a good idea to  consult with Legal or Tax if this comes up for more specific advice. These general rules relate to which Enron entity should be the legal  counterparty to the transactions. This doesn't determine where within the  Enron family the actual risk should ultimately reside. If we want the risk  to be in an Enron company other than the Enron counterparty for contractual  purposes, an intercompany transaction should be booked (probably through RMT)  to get the risk in the right place.",Enron Entity for Financial Trading,taylor-m

6254,_659.subject,"Enron rings opening bell for bandwidth      exchange       By Corey Grice      Staff Writer, CNET News.com      December 2, 1999, 5:40 p.m. PT        The opening bell has rung for a new kind of exchange. The currency? Bandwidth. A subsidiary of energy industry giant Enron, Enron Communications, today  opened the      doors to a bandwidth commodity exchange. The company first announced its  intention to      sell space on high-speed networks as a commodity in May. Traditional commodity exchanges sell goods like  oil, natural                             gas and grain. Enron has taken this concept and  given it a                             telecommunications spin, offering space on  high-speed                             networks to communications carriers. In the past, carriers looking to fill holes or  service gaps in                             their networks would have had to enter long-term  contracts                             with other carriers to fulfill their bandwidth  needs. The                             exchange, Enron says, acts as a sort of middleman  for                             carriers to find short-term contracts or quick  fixes as they                             complete network construction or try to manage                             heavier-than-expected network traffic. For example, Global Crossing plans to sell  capacity on a                             high-speed fiber optic link between New York and  Los                             Angeles over the exchange. Enron also expects to start an international bandwidth trading market  next May.

I suggested that you contact Donna Lowry to confirm both my  understanding and that the security in question is not on teh Restricted List.

6266,_806.subject,"The system is certainly not set up to accommodate that now but we could  probably draft around it on a case by case basis. It strikes me that while  we might be able to come up with a legal framework that would allow for this,  the credit considerations are more problematic. I would guess that the back  office will also be unhappy about having to manually rearrange all of the  trades. This really seems like it is similar to the Aquilla problem in some  respects. When we suggested allowing one entity to trade for another, Credit  was quite concerned because the system wouldn't be able to check the  appropriate headroom. I suppose Credit could just assign the lowest headroom  for any of the eligible entities to the entire relationship - would  that be  acceptable to everyone? Another possibility is for the fund to set up a  master trading entity which does the trades with us and then does back to  back deals with whichever entities need the allocations. That would let them  do a large transaction on EOL and then smaller transactions with the other  entities. Of course, the master trading entity would need to qualify for  credit on its own somehow. Guarantees from anyone other than the owner would  be difficult (upstream guarantee problems).",One Password - multiple legal entities,taylor-m
6267,_807.subject,"We met with the commercial team this afternoon and I was able to piece  together the following:  Access to the auction site will be by clicking on a button on the EnronOnline  (note spelling) trading page. Most users of the site will already be signed up for EnronOnline - both a PA  and ETA executed. Other users will be given a user ID and password that give them ""guest""  access to EnronOnline and trading access to the auction page. On the auction page the users may submit their offers to transact (either to  buy or sell) with Enron. The page will list a reserve price and identify the  number of credits to be auctioned. We are willing to commit to transact up  to that number with the best bidders (at or beyond the reserve  price) but  may transact larger volumes if we choose. Users' offers may be submitted at any time during the auction period (this  time frame remains a bit unclear - probably one day, possibly a week or more)  and must remain binding until the close of the bidding and determination of  winning bidders. Certain uncreditworthy users may be required to post a deposit in the full  amount of their offer to buy. It is not yet clear if we will publish the offers after the fact (maybe just  the winning offers - all without names of course) or even during the auction  period but we would like to have that option. I'm sure I've missed a few points but that gives you the flavor. Harry is  preparing the ""GTC"" for the actual purchases and sales - I assume based on  our standard contracts for these products. We need to put the legal  framework together for the rest of it. If the existing PA and ETA are  adequate, that would be great but I haven't reread them with that in mind. We REALLY don't want to have to have existing users sign another piece of  paper. It makes sense that the existing ETA covers some territory that won't  matter to users who only have access to the auction page (e.g. references to  master agreements) so a stripped down version of the ETA for those  counterparties would make sense.

6283,_889.subject,"Why is Enron's stock so volatile now? Since today's session started, ENE      has lost another $2.50! Mr. Ken Lay replies      I haven't had a chance to check our stock today, but I think for several  reasons      it's more volatile. But before I comment on that, our stock price is  still up even      if it went down that much today. It's up 40% since the beginning of the  year      when the Dow was down. As recently as mid-December, the stock price is up      about 75%. That's one reason why it's so volatile. Some people bought in      along the way, they've had a good strong increase, particularly with the      uncertainty in the marketplace, people just want to take some money off  the      table. As we become more of a technology stock, a high P/E stock, a  growth      stock held by growth portfolios, you're going to have more volatility,  just like all      the other companies that fit into that category. Throughout the market,      technology stocks quite often go up or down not just $3-$4 a whack, but  often      $10-$12-$15 a whack. What I tell Mark Koenig is I love that volatility  on the      upside, but I hate it on the down side. We've had a change in the ownership of our stock. Increasingly, it's  being      bought by the growth portfolio managers, and increasingly it's being  sold by      the value and other portfolio managers that picked it up at much lower      valuations, and now at these values they want to take their money and  put it      back into lower P/E stocks. I know this makes everybody a little  nervous, but      this is probably the world we're in now.

6292,_935.subject,"Pets In the Office  It's A Growing Trend   In the dog-eat-dog world of business, there's a growing trend at some  companies. Workers are bringing their  pets to the office. Chip Paucek, who produces educational videos and television programs, has  been taking his golden retriever,  Hoss, to work for the last five years. Paucek and Hoss visited The Early  Show and talked with Co-Anchor  Jane Clayson. The dog has became the office mascot, says Paucek. ""He brings a lot of  emotion and people love it. He's  very relaxed."" But Paucek, as co-president of his company, has the freedom to bring Hoss to  the office if he wishes. Not  everybody can bring their pet to work. ""A lot of it depends on the dog,"" says Paucek, who explains that Hoss is not  a rowdy dog. ""He just hangs out,"" explains Paucek. ""He's easy to get along with."" Hoss has free rein at the office. When Paucek is away on trips, ""My wife  brings him in and drops him off at  the office,"" Paucek says. While there are plenty of positives to pets in the workplace, there are also  many legal issues to consider. John  Challenger, CEO of an international placement company, agrees that the trend  of bringing pets to the work  place is really growing. ""More and more companies in this tight labor market are trying to make their  working place  employee-friendly and many are looking at bringing pets into the workplace,""  says Challenger    He points out, however, that there are serious issues that employers and  employees need to explore before  they adopt a pets-in-the-office policy. ""One of the things that the companies must do, before they jump into a  policy like that, is take a poll  of their employees and find out what they're thinking. If you have certain  employees that don't feel  comfortable with pets, you might want to rethink the policy."" There are liability questions as well. For example, the company might be  liable if a dog or cat bites or  scratches another employee. ""The company ought to talk with their attorneys before they put this kind of  policy in effect,"" says  Challenger. ""The employee needs to understand that if their dog bites  someone or the cat scratches  someone, it can't be the company's fault."" Allergies are a major deterrent to bringing cats to the office. ""Many people are allergic to cat hair. You have to think, as an employer,  will you put them in a  certain part of your space. What about people who are afraid of animals? Many don't feel  comfortable with them around. Just how many do you want? Do you want cats  and dogs and what  about birds? What about the noise of birds?"" Paucek admits that when there's more than one pet in the office, ""It gets  chaotic."" In 1997, the American Animal Hospital Association surveyed 1,225 pet owners. They found that:         21% of those surveyed had taken their pets to work        76% feel guilty about leaving their pets at home while they're on the  job        33% said they leave a TV or radio on for their animals    If a company decides to allow pets in the office, they should:         poll employees before they let the pets come        provide a written policy about pets and list which pets are not welcome  in the office        establish an off-limits-to-pets area        make sure employees bring documents proving pets are vaccinated        bar noisy, destructive, or messy animals from the office        tell employees to keep control of their animals at all times    If many employees want to bring their pets to the office, the company should  make a rotating schedule. When the pets-in-the-office policy does work, it's great. Paucek says when  he and Hoss arrive at work, ""I get  off the elevator. He goes one way and I go the other. He says hello to the  employees. He has his own  web page.""",Pets in the Office,taylor-m

6299,_999.subject,"Hi Dave:  Thanks for your note! It's hard to believe that Washington House was over  twenty years ago now. I left DC at the end of that summer and went to law  school in Michigan. My first job after graduating was for a law firm in  Houston. They opened a New York office in the mid 80's and I went there to  help out. The office wasn't successful but I loved living in New York so I  moved to another firm there and stayed for almost 8 years total. One of  those years was spent working in Asia - primarily Indonesia and Hong Kong. I've now moved back to Houston where I am a lawyer with Enron - a large  energy company - and focus on derivatives and online trading legal issues. We have offices in several countries around the world which I get to visit  periodically. I'm actually writing this from Buenos Aires where I'm helping  them get some products ready to trade online. I get back to Washington a  couple of times a year to do some lobbying for the company and may actually  have been there when you were in town - I think I was there the 11th & 12th. I've stayed in touch with Doc Kieft and Mark Kopinski and get back to M.C. from time to time. Mark lives in New York where he manages a couple of  international mutual funds for American Century. I was on the Alumni Board  for a few years so got back for their meetings at Homecoming and got to see  the people who came back - unfortunately I haven't really stayed in touch  very well. There have been a number of changes to the campus since our time  so you may be surprised if you haven't been back for a while - of course  Woodbine is gone, there's a new theater, a big addition to the gym and  several major interior renovations. And I understand there are big plans for  more - they are going to close Sixth Street, tear down Gibson and expand the  campus a block to the west with at least one new dorm, a big expansion to the  sports facilities (indoor track, pool, etc.) and a redesign of the library. Enrollment is up above 1000. Congratulations on your successful career - who would have thought when we  got out of school so many years ago that Monmouth grads could do this well! There are doctors, bankers, chemists and lawyers everywhere you look. I  guess we really did learn something while we were there. Let me know if you ever get to Texas.

6311,_203.subject,"Below is a summary of the discussions last week regarding the complaint  against El Paso for oversubscribing the Socal Topock Point. The meeting started out by summarizing the dollar impact of the Border cuts  to Amoco and Burlington of $3 million dollars and the additional fuel costs   of $15 million that they have incurred when the mainline fuel was reduced and  the gathering fuel was increased. Accordingly, producers are seeking a  minimum of $17  million in compensation in some form or  another. The biggest concern is that a total of 1.2 bcf/day is being nominated at the  Socal Topock which can only deliver 540000 mmbtu/day. Socal Gas stated that  this problem should go away when there system becomes unbundled (referred to  as Gatekeeper).. The proceeding is currently pending CPUC approval and could  be implemented as early as October 1, 2001. When the Gatekeeper is  implemented  , only 540000 mmbtu/day will be accepted at the Socal Topock  border and must match up with the intra-state transport. SoCal Gas suggested taking the 1.2 bcf/day of nominations at the Topock  delivery point and divide it up based on the original intent of the  capapcity-  400 to Mohave; 540 to Socal Topock;  and 180 to PGE Topock. They  also stated they would accept less than 540 at Topock but  needed a minimum  of 300 to meet core needs. However, they wanted some type of compensation if  their volume was reduced. They also agreed to live with the status quo  until the Gatekeeper was implemented. This would result in firm rights being  established at Socal Topock based on downstream rights. Williams owns Block 3 capacity and is willing to look at a CD reduction or a  reduced take requirement or use of alternate points with a rate adjustment. After much discussion,  El Paso came back with the following counter proposal:  Recommended interim solution until Socal Gatekeeper implemented. Does not  relate to receipt point rights. 1)  Block 1 Capacity will always be alternate to Socal Topock (198000);  2)Block II Capacity can not be sold at PGE Topock (614000)  3) Amoco and OneOk each have a contract 45000/d which can go to Topock or  Ehrenberg. It is recommended that they  give up their Ehrenberg right and keep Topock right and Socal will give up  like amount at Topock as well as shift an additional  70000 mmbtu/day from  Topock to Ehrenberg resulting in approx. 115000 being shifted  to Ehrenberg. 4) Rights fro expansion shippers would be carved up as follows:     Socal Topock   PGE/Mohave Topock Texaco   40    135 Burlington  26    74 Aero   5    15 Borax   7    12 LADWP  0    36 SWGas   0    20  5) Socal Topock would now be divided as follows:  Expansion Shippers  78000  Socal Gas           425000 BLK 3                               348000 (25-Amoco;20-Oneok;99-Williams;189  El Paso Merchant;15-Wlliams) Total 851000 540 divided by 841 would result in 37 percent cuts or 63 percent thruput. The producers were not happy with having to live with 37 percent cuts and  felt that any transport sold after their Sept 28 complaint should be cut off  the top which would be El Paso merchant services Blk 3. Separate meetings were then held amongst the Topock shippers to duscuss El  Paso's counter -proposal.",El Paso Complaint,tholt-j

In the past, government authorities set the price that utiliti= es=20 could charge for gas, and customers were bound by rigid, long-term contract= s.=20 But=20 with deregulation, the market determines energy prices, and both suppliers= =20 and consumers have more flexibility in how they buy and deliver goods. The  new Enron moved swiftly to cash in on these changing dynamics by creating = a=20 trading platform to bring together buyers and sellers. Enron repeated the= =20 process with electricity when the government began deregulating that market= =20 in the 1990s. Lay has long been hailed as Enron's visionary, but COO Skilling is no slouc= h.=20 ""Jeff is one of the brightest and most creative people I've ever known,"" sa= ys=20 Lay,=20 who began working with him in the mid-1980s when Skilling was a McKinsey=20 consultant helping Enron develop its gas-trading system. ""I've made it clea= r=20 for  some time that he's my successor."" The 46-year-old Skilling, who officiall= y=20 joined Enron in 1990, likes to toss around words like awesome and cool when  describing the company's business. Lay's language is slightly less colorfu= l=20 but no less enthusiastic when the CEO is talking about Enron's future. Lay and Skilling both agree that the best ideas often come up from the=20 bottom. ""We've flattened the organization, made it more entrepreneurial, an= d=20 developed a culture to take risks and try new ideas,"" Lay says. Take Michae= l=20 Moulton, 30, who is working in Enron's pulp-and-paper trading unit. Moulton= =20 came up with the notion to make markets in DRAM chips, and when the new uni= t=20 begins its operations later this year, he will run it. Wholesale Energy Despite its broad range of businesses and expansive aspirations, Enron is= =20 still at its core an energy company. During the first nine months of this= =20 year,=20 nearly $56 billion of its $60 billion in revenue came from its wholesale=20 energy operation, which centers around making markets in and creating=20 risk-management=20 products for natural gas and electricity. Some of what Enron sells comes fr= om=20 its own gas production and electric-power generation, but the bulk of it is= =20 bought=20 from other energy producers with excess capacity. The company's trading capacity has gotten a tremendous boost from=20 EnronOnline, which now handles about 60 percent of its transaction volume.= =20 Margins  are razor-thin =01* maybe a penny per million BTUs of gas or per megawatt = of=20 electricity (standard contract measures). But Enron isn't doing trades just= =20 to=20 make money; it does them to create liquid spot markets that in turn enable = it=20 to package together risk-management products, such as futures and swap=20 contracts, that companies can use to hedge their energy costs. Enron is a= =20 principal in every trade, taking full responsibility for actual delivery of= =20 the product,=20 be it gas, electricity, or even pulp and paper. Overall margins in the=20 wholesale energy business average one to three percent. Trading is a risky business, of course, but few companies manage risk bette= r=20 than Enron, which has armies of people working to stay on top of sudden pri= ce=20 moves. ""Enron seems to make all the right calls because it has the best=20 modeling systems, hires the brightest people, and has trading experience=20 throughout=20 the country,"" says Gregory Phelps, a portfolio manager at John Hancock Fund= s=20 who closely follows the utilities sector. Enron employs a dozen=20 meteorologists=20 on its gas-trading floor to monitor any weather changes =01* from an oncomi= ng=20 cold snap in Chicago to a potential hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico =01* th= at=20 could affect=20 supply and demand. Now Enron has turned its sights on Europe, which is in the early stages of= =20 deregulation. Enron established a presence in the U.K., Germany and=20 Scandinavia=20 in the early to mid-1990s. It currently has 18 offices in 16 countries,=20 making markets and hedging risks in a region where state-owned utilities=20 still loom large and=20 national differences present formidable hurdles. ""We're the only company wi= th=20 pan-European operations,"" says Mark Frevert, who heads the wholesale energy  unit. ""There's a lot of complexity, but we like markets where it's=20 difficult."" Broadband Operations The roots of Enron's bandwidth trading go back to 1997, when the company=20 bought Portland General Electric to gain a foothold in the West Coast energ= y  market. At the time, the utility was laying fiber-optic cable alongside it= s=20 gas pipeline that ran between Portland and Salt Lake City, and as it was=20 being deployed,=20 ""the Enron mind-set of 'Can we trade this stuff?' kicked in,"" says Kenneth= =20 Rice, CEO of Enron Broadband Services. ""Bandwidth lends itself well to bein= g=20 traded like=20 a commodity."" Today Enron buys excess bandwidth from Internet service providers and from= =20 carriers such as AT&T (NYSE: T), Global Crossing (NYSE: GX) and Qwest  (NYSE: Q). As it does with energy, Enron bundles together bandwidth, then= =20 sells and delivers it on an as-needed basis to content providers, network= =20 carriers,  and other end-users. Enron promises to deliver capacity at a set time and= =20 for a specified period over a fiber-optic network that stretches nearly=20 15,000 miles  and connects some 30 major cities in the United States, Europe,and Japan. Enron is certainly ambitious. It wants to change the way bandwidth is sold,= =20 which up until now has been in fixed-rate monthly contracts that lock buyer= s=20 into=20 paying for capacity they don't always need. Enron provides bandwidth on=20 demand that users can purchase and procure on short notice for short period= s=20 of=20 time =01* for instance, if a company wants to broadcast a streaming video o= f its=20 CEO to its offices around the globe. The company made its first bandwidth trade last December when it sold a=20 monthly contract for DS-3 bandwidth between New York City and Los Angeles o= n=20 a Global Crossing network. (DS-3 is an industry standard for moving data at=  a=20 speed of 45 megabits per second, fast enough for streaming video.) Enron  delivered 1,399 months' worth of DS-3 broadband capacity in the third=20 quarter alone and is on target to meet its year-end goal of 5,000 DS-3=20 months. Both  Lay and Skilling think bandwidth trading will contribute $1 billion in=20 annual operating profits in five years, or nearly as much as wholesale ener= gy=20 contributed=20 in 1999. Meanwhile, the company expects to pour another $650 million into= =20 broadband services during each of the next two years, offset by the pending= =20 $2=20 billion sale of Portland General to Sierra Pacific Resources (NYSE: SRP). The other major piece of Enron's broadband strategy centers on delivering= =20 streaming video. Using Sun Microsystems (Nasdaq: SUNW) servers and switches  made by Lucent Technologies (NYSE: LU) and Cisco Systems (Nasdaq: CSCO) ,= =20 along with its own internally developed software, Enron's broadband system  is built to whisk data around Internet traffic jams. Content customers ran= ge=20 from corporations doing video conferencing to retail chain Blockbuster (NYS= E:=20 BBI),=20 which this summer inked a 20-year deal to distribute video-on-demand over= =20 Enron's network. ""Video will be the king application,"" Skilling says. ""That= 's=20 where=20 it's all going to happen."" Other Growth Drivers Some people may have questioned Enron's decision to plunk down $100 million= =20 for the 30-year naming rights to Enron Field, the Houston Astros' new=20 retractable-dome baseball stadium. But the deal also helped Enron seal a=20 30-year, $200 million agreement to outsource the energy management of the= =20 stadium. So Enron not only boosted its corporate profile but also made $100= =20 million in the process. Energy outsourcing is a potentially immense market, considering that U.S.= =20 businesses spend more than $240 billion on heat and electricity to run thei= r=20 operations every year. Enter Enron Energy Services, which does everything= =20 from analyzing a company's energy supply chain to pinpointing its=20 energy-guzzling equipment to financing the cost of buying more-efficient=20 gear. The group spent nearly a year under the hood at Simon Property Group  (NYSE: SPG) before making recommendations that landed it a 10-year, $1.5= =20 billion contract to buy and manage the energy for Simon's 253 real-estate= =20 properties. ""The complexity of this business is so enormous that if you're= =20 going to be the leader, you've got to know every detail,"" says Marty Sunde, head of the group's North American unit. Energy savings can be significant. Enron guarantees eight to 13 percent, bu= t=20 sometimes the savings can be even greater. The business, which began=20 in 1997, recently started turning a profit and is expected to have earnings= =20 before interest and taxes, or EBIT, of $80 million this year. Enron is on= =20 target to=20 land $16 billion in customer contracts in 2000, double last year's total.= =20 ""There's no reason this business can't roughly double in each of the next f= ew=20 years,""=20 Lay says. ""Enron is very, very confident. Their tone borders on excessive confidence,= =20 but their track record warrants that."" =01* Erik Gustafson, Senior Portfolio Manager, Stein Roe & Farnham  The Competition Some of Enron's trading partners are also its biggest rivals in reshaping t= he=20 deregulated energy markets and forging ahead in telecommunications. Dynegy (NYSE: DYN), located just a few blocks away from Enron in Houston a= nd=20 called ""Enron Jr."" by at least one analyst, has its own gas- and=20 electricity-trading operations and is looking into bandwidth trading. The= =20 same goes for Williams Companies (NYSE: WMB), whose fiber-optic network is  much larger than Enron's. A consortium of six energy companies, including= =20 Aquila Energy, a leading power marketer, just launched an online=20 energy-trading=20 system to rival EnronOnline. Several existing bandwidth traders, including Arbinet-thexchange,RateXchang= e=20 (AMEX: RTX) and Band-X, essentially provide Web-based bulletin boards  for companies to find trading partners. They don't actually deliver the=20 product, which Enron feels gives it an advantage. In the energy-services=20 business,=20 Enron competes with a whole host of players, including consultants, regiona= l=20 utilities and energy outsourcers, but none have Enron's geographic scope. ""It's a challenge to value Enron's stock, because it's such a hybrid. It=20 always seems expensive, but it continues to outperform expectations."" =01* Zach Wagner, Analyst, Edward D. Jones & Co.  What It's Worth Analysts and Enron management alike prefer to break down the company along= =20 its four reported business lines using a sum-of-the-parts model. They=20 also typically value the company's businesses in terms of EBIT, judging tha= t=20 to be a more consistent way to evaluate Enron's income because its business= es  are so capital intensive. Using those metrics and a recent stock price of= =20 $80, Enron's pipeline transportation and distribution business is roughly= =20 valued at $5, wholesale energy at $40, energy services at $20 and broadband services at= =20 $15. Skilling believes the multiple of 30 times EBIT assigned to wholesale= =20 energy=20 is too low considering that business is expected to grow 35 percent this=20 year, to $1.8 billion, some 70 percent of Enron's projected total EBIT. And= =20 wholesale=20 energy's EBIT growth is likely to exceed 30 percent annually for at least t= he=20 next five years on the strength of further deregulation of global energy=20 markets.=20 Combine that with similar expected growth rates in both energy services and= =20 broadband,=20 not to mention the potential for new commodity-trading markets, and, Skilli= ng=20 argues, Enron's stock is easily worth $130. Analysts are more cautious. Most agree that wholesale energy deserves a=20 higher premium than the market is currently willing to pay, but bandwidth i= s=20 still=20 a couple of years away from profitability. In the meantime, Salomon Smith= =20 Barney analyst Ray Niles suggests that investors focus on the market=20 potential=20 of bandwidth trading, and that the quick acceptance of this product in the= =20 market could mirror the steady early growth of electricity trading in the= =20 mid-1990s. Niles thinks Enron's overall energy operations alone are worth more than= =20 Enron's current share price. If that's true, tacking on the $15 EBIT value= =20 for bandwidth  would make Enron a $100 stock. Ultimately, many investors will look at plain old earnings per share. If=20 Enron meets analysts' consensus earnings forecast of $1.65 a share next yea= r=20 =01* and  maintains its current multiple of 56 times earnings =01* it would be worth=  $92. Social Responsibility Enron has won awards each of the past three years for its efforts to reduce= =20 methane emissions and has been applauded for its wind-power division. But= =20 certain Enron projects, such as the construction of its Dabhol power plant = in=20 India, have been mired in controversy. The state police there squelched=20 protests=20 against the plant in 1996 and 1997 with beatings and jailings, and Human=20 Rights Watch asserted that Enron was complicit because it benefited from th= e=20 suppression of dissent and didn't speak out against human rights violations= .=20 Enron has since built a 50-bed hospital in the area and committed $500,000  to improve the community's water and sanitation infrastructures. The Upside With less than half of the residential power market in the U.S. open to=20 competition, electricity deregulation is far from over. Some analysts belie= ve=20 the entire=20 market will be deregulated within five years. This would enable Enron to=20 expand its leading energy-trading business. On the retail side, Enron could= =20 get a=20 boost from the New Power Company, a partnership it formed with AOL (NYSE:= =20 AOL) and IBM (NYSE: IBM) aimed at selling electricity to homeowners via  the Internet. Enron's attempt to sell residential electricity in Californi= a=20 ended in failure in 1998, and the company readily admits this isn't one of= =20 its strengths.=20 So it's relying on IBM's back-office expertise to handle the paperwork and= =20 AOL's Internet service to penetrate homes while Enron procures the power. The Downside The much-ballyhooed broadband revolution has failed to meet expectations.= =20 Currently, only five percent of U.S. households have broadband access, and  Forrester Research analyst Maribel Dolinov says the rollout of so-called= =20 last-mile connections, which take broadband signals into homes, is moving= =20 very=20 slowly. She doesn't expect wide-scale availability of video-on-demand befor= e=20 2004.  Who Needs It? Enron's mix of the old and new economies should appeal to all but the most= =20 conservative investors.

BLIZZARDS PRODUCE HIGH RATINGS FOR WEATHER CHANNEL, RECORD PAGE VIEWS More people turned to The Weather Channel instead of their local TV affiliates to get news about this week's blizzards in Chicago and Detroit, and nearly 25 million viewers - a record - went to  weather.com to follow the storms. In a survey by Survey USA, 25 percent of TV viewers said they found out about the blizzard from The Weather Channel, compared with 17 percent who watched their local NBC affiliate station, and 12 percent who tuned into a local radio station for news. TWC also was the winner - at 30 percent - with those who said the weather network did the best job of covering the storm. Another 16 percent said their NBC affiliate did the best job, and 13 percent said Chicago and Detroit CBS affiliates were tops. A record number of pageviews - 24.6 million - were recorded at weather.com. TWC produced a 6 a.m. to 12 p.m. rating of 0.751 on Monday, delivering an average of 586,000 households.

6336,_89.subject,"Shares of Enron Corp. (NYSE: ENE - Quotes, News, Boards) were smacked around  again yesterday, following close on the heels of seven-session decline that  sent the stock down more than 13 points, or 16%, from its recent high of  $84.63 (December 28), all amid uncertainty and considerable volatility. The pullback doesn't appear to be company-specific exactly, although the  rumblings in a certain geographic region, namely California, are triggering  aftershocks  throughout the U.S. energy community. As we outlined in a report on January 4, the energy situation in California  has rapidly reached crisis proportions. Strict environmental legislation and  the uncertain  profit potential post-deregulation has kept utilities from installing  sufficient generating capacity in the state over the last 10 years. The state's two major utilities, PG&E Corp. (NYSE: PCG - Quotes, News,  Boards) and Edison International (NYSE: EIX - Quotes, News, Boards) , are  facing the  prospect of eventual insolvency due to the spiraling costs of electricity  purchased on the open market. However, the rates the utilities can charge  their customers  for power represent a fraction of the costs that prevailed during the  gradual rollout of full-scale deregulation. The risks to Enron are two-fold. For one, the crisis in California may result in a default of payments to the  state's major wholesale energy providers, including Enron. Although the  company does  operate in California, the bottom-line impact would likely be shielded to a  considerable degree because of Enron's size, strength, and diversified global  revenue  streams. In addition, Enron would likely be high on the list of default  payees given its importance to future wholesale energy supplies in the  region. More significantly, investors are concerned that California legislators may  pull the plug on deregulation entirely, or at least until the current crisis  abates. Some also  fear this mess might derail utility deregulation in other states as  regulators and politicians alike become fearful of adverse and unintended  economic consequences. Neither scenario is probable. For one thing, the airline industry was  deregulated in fits and starts, with plenty of mistakes and recrimination  along the way. And a  strong argument can be made that the shortage of electric power would have  pressured rates sharply higher even in a fully regulated environment. The California Public Utility Commission will attempt to decide the best  course of action this week. It appears inevitable that, regardless of PG&E  and Edison's  ultimate fate, the state's energy consumers will likely absorb much of the  burden through an increase in the prevailing rate cap. Enron has also fallen victim to the rotation out of strong defensive stocks  on the heels of the Federal Reserve's unexpected interest-rate cuts last  week. The initial  euphoria has waned, however, upon the realization that the sharp rate cuts  will serve to offset what appears to be a rapid rate of erosion in domestic  economic  growth, rather than generating a rebound in economic activity. As a result,  we expect investors once again to seek the shelter of well-capitalized  defensive plays  like Enron. We would emphasize that several factors that weigh in Enron's favor have been  overlooked amid the California crisis. The November-December period was  18% colder than normal and the second-coldest start to the winter months in  the past 50 years. Coupled with an uncertain supply situation, particularly  in natural  gas, Enron stands to profit handsomely from energy volatility and pricing, an  environment that is likely to exist for at least the next 12 months. In addition, Enron's diversification into still more new avenues of growth  help to insulate the company from additional challenges of this sort in the  future. The  markets for EnronOnline, a real-time commodities exchange vehicle, and  Enron's broadband services unit are expected to at least triple over the next  year. An eventual inflection point in the groups' profitability would serve to send  profits measurably higher in the long term. Despite the recent turmoil, Enron's consensus earnings estimate for 2001,  according to First Call, has come down a mere penny, to $1.65 a share. Although the  stock's rich price/earnings multiple of 43 times may aggravate its near-term  volatility, the absence of a complete collapse of the stock indicates the  market  approves of Enron's maneuvers so far and is confident in its prospects going  forward",Enron,weldon-c

6371,_11.subject,"If the last Hoegh Galleon cargo of this year is diverted to Puerto Rico, the  economics of sending non-Cabot LNG to Puerto Rico are different than those  mentioned in my prior note. Based on current prices, there is $0.7 MM of value that could be captured  between Enron LNG and Eco on the diversion. This represents the price  difference between what it would cost to buy back our sale to ENA at CMS and  what Eco would have had to pay Cabot for a Winter Cargo. If CMS would let us  out of the terminal fee or let it apply to a future delivery, that would add  an additional $1 MM of value. If Cabot had to give up its Demand Charge and  Demand Surcharge (hard to imagine) on the Winter Cargo, that adds another  $4.7 MM. A second Hoegh Galleon cargo should add $1.5 MM but would need to be sourced  from Nigeria or Algeria(???). Cabot controls the date of the Last Cargo delivered in 2001. It can be  November 23-December 15 (unless another date is mutually agreeable). The date  of this last delivery determines the earliest date that Eco would be able to  receive the Hoegh Galleon. The earliest that Eco could receive the Hoegh  Galleon should therefore be between December 20 and January 11 - depends on  Cabot. Eco would be able to receive a second Hoegh Galleon cargo as soon as 29 days  after the first Hoegh Galleon cargo delivery or as late as 45 days after. Two  Hoegh Galleon cargoes should give Eco enough fuel (barely) to get them to the  dates where they are eligible to receive the Early Spring cargo (100 days  after the Last Cargo of 2001). In addition to the $$$'s available to be captured, this program removes Eco's  risk of not receiving a Winter Cargo from Cabot. Economics and Timing -  The amount of value to be captured is most heavily  influenced by December-January NYMEX prices. These impact our cost to buy  back gas at the CMS tailgate and our cost to buy the second Hoegh Galleon  cargo. Our gas cost is more subject to change than is the Cabot contract  price we are trying to beat. If we had a crystal ball, we would lock-in the  economics of the diversion and of the purchase of the second cargo when the  NYMEX bottoms-out. The front of the price curve has lost ~$1.00/MMBtu in the  last 2 weeks. Where will it go from here? In order to be prepared to execute when market conditions are right, we need  to get Eco on board and initiate discussions with a producer about supply for  the second cargo. Also, we should talk with Gene Massey to confirm that the  contract says what we think it says and to get his thoughts on what we are  trying to do. I would appreciate any insights that you may have regarding this opportunity. Regards,",Update - EcoElectrica Winter Cargo,ybarbo-p

6373,_9.subject,"The attached spreadsheet allows you to easily calculate Eco's year-end LNG  inventory for a variety of cases that vary dispatch rate, # days of outage  for CT1, and number of cargoes diverted between now and year-end. Simply  enter your assumption for number of days of CT1 outage in cell A16 and the  number of cargoes you want to divert in cell A23. The year-end inventory is  automatically calculated. A negative number means that you require more LNG  than you are entitled to receive. Assuming that you want the LNG tank full at year-end:  1. Eco will be able to receive 100% of the remaining 6 cargoes if the CT1  outage is 60 days or less  2. 175 days of CT1 outage are required to result in Eco being able to divert  1 cargo and still have a full tank at year-end  3. a 60-175 day outage for CT1 results in surplus LNG but whether or not it  is enough to market depends on how much the outage exceeds 60 days  The above figures assume a 76% dispatch and 95% availability on days that Eco  is not assumed to be in an outage.
